This unique event will allow fans to relive the magic of their music and also see the bands Frontside and Hostia.\n\nIllusion are undoubtedly one of the most important rock bands in Poland. Their history dates back to 1992, when, in Gdańsk, former She and Skawalker musician Tomasz ‘Lipa’ Lipnicki, Jerzy ‘Jerry’ Rutkowski and Paweł Herbasch founded the band. The first Illusion concert took place in February 1992 in Gdańsk, and already in August of the same year, Jarosław Śmigiel joined them. In this line-up, the band functions to this day. Illusion\'s debut album was released in 1993, which featured vocalist Grzegorz ‘Guzik’ Guziński and guitarist Janusz Sokołowski as guests. Illusion concerts are invariably hugely popular. The band is known for their energetic performances, which infect the audience with an incredible dose of rock energy. During the upcoming tour, fans will have the opportunity to hear them in cities such as Warsaw, Krakow and Poznań.\n\nThe upcoming tour will also be special for fans of the band Frontside, who will be reminding fans of their third album *The Twilight of the Gods - First Step to a Mental Revolution*. This album premiered in October 2004 and this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, Mystic Production will reissue this classic release on CD and for the first time as an LP. One of Frontside\'s most recognisable songs - *Our Destiny is to Burn* - comes from this album. During the tour, Frontside will present a set based on this iconic album, but without forgetting other key songs from throughout their career. The band, known for their dynamic live shows, has this time prepared a completely new setlist that is sure to delight both regular fans and new listeners.\n\nHostia is a Polish revelation of recent years on the grindcore scene. Known for their brutal, uncompromising songs, the band quickly won the hearts of heavy sound lovers. Their music combines fast, aggressive sounds with a rocking groove and catchy patents hidden under a layer of noise. Hostia have released one EP and three full-length albums, the latest of which *Nailed* was released in November 2022 on Deformeathing Productions.','https://goout.net/i/099/999227-383.jpg','2024-11-29 19:00:00','2024-11-29 23:59:59',14534,5),(31748,'Zion Train + Riddim Pressure Soundsystem','Legendary British band Zion Train returns to Krakow to celebrate 35 years of activity.

At the same time, everything will be streamed on the band\'s YouTube channel – you can watch the four previous editions there, where Harvest played with Percival, Zywiołak, Lysa Gora, Kosy, Rustica, Gudar, Huskarl and Dziwoludy. We invite you to show up in costumes that relate to the climate and theme of the event – a gift from the hosts (the band Żniwa) awaits those who dress up.\n\nŻniwa is a married couple of multi-instrumentalists in love, Skjere and Raido. They play neo-Celtic, Slavic and Nordic pagan folk, inspired by ancient beliefs, legends and fantasy. They exclusively use acoustic instruments – including the lute guitar, five-string violin, didgeridoo, various drums, Celtic harp, talharpa and Irish, concert and overtone flutes. Both members of Żniwa are also part of the touring line-up of the group Żywiołak.\n\nThe Lodz duo Furda reinterprets a wide spectrum of traditional music, using electronics, throat singing and traditional instruments from around the world, with the Biłgoraj suka—a rare Slavic fiddle-like instrument—at the forefront. They perform their instruments and effects themselves. The result of their explorations is hypnotic tribal ambient with an almost club-like rhythm; they cite the neofolk acts Heilung and Omnia, as well as IDM producer Lorn, among their inspirations. 2021 saw the release of Furda\'s first and so far most recent album, *Bojany*.\n\nThe music of Daj Ognia wanders between Poland and Scandinavia, playing at dancehouses, stypas and sacred groves. Along the way, they stop at painted gates in inns on the frozen Baltic Sea. They play to the feet and reverie of people from thatched roofs and asbestos roofs, interweaving the musical traditions of the north and south. They play old country tunes in their own anachronistic fashion, evoking the moods of an imaginary village – a plebeian ruckus, echoes of rituals, cries of death in maidenhood and the stomping of bare feet on frozen soil. Weaving a musical tale, they make use of the sounds of archaic string lyres, traditional singing, bagpipes, drums and bones, weaving together into a melancholy yet uplifting sound.\n\n**Entry to the concert hall constitutes indicates consent to the recording and broadcast of audio and video material with their image.**','https://goout.net/i/127/1273633-383.jpg','2024-12-07 19:00:00','2024-12-07 23:59:59',14543,5),(31759,'Pidżama Porno','Pidżama Porno was formed in December 1987, on the initiative of Krzysztof Grabowski and Andrzej Kozakiewicz.

Over the years, most Polish rock stars have celebrated their birthdays with Pidżama.

It was started by musician Robert Jaworski – then known for his work with folk staple Warsaw Village Band, among others – who, alongside Open Folk guitarist Robert Wasilewski, weaved threads of Polish folk demonology, Slavic folk music and the madness of experimental musicking. These foundations have led to a deeply idiosyncratic and recognisable sound. Their stage setup has included a hurdy-gurdy, rebec, guile, lute guitar, acoustic bass guitar, flutes (classical, modified quena, baritone flute), five-stringed and baritone violins, traditional drums and percussion instruments, as well as  vocal techniques including white voice and throat singing. They are probably the first folk band to live to be listed in an encyclopaedia of rock music.\n\nŻywiołak\'s latest album, entitled *Dekonstrukcja historyczna I*, is an attempt to draw forgotten meanings from familiar holidays and show these meanings in the musical context of indigenous religion. It is also an attempt by artists to confront the highly complex subject of the legacy of Slavic mythology in Poland. *Dekonstrukcja historyczna* is an important voice on the issue of cultural social consciousness and a very strong discourse on the condition of Polish identity, carried out invariably since the band\'s first album.','https://goout.net/i/113/1134349-383.jpg','2024-11-29 20:00:00','2024-11-29 23:59:59',14549,5),(31766,'Dieter Bohlen','# *You\'re My Heart, You\'re My Soul*, *Brother Louie*, *Cheri Cheri Lady* or *You Can Win If You Want* – the author of these hits, Dieter Bohlen, will come to Warsaw\'s Progresja to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the legendary Modern Talking.\n\nIt is to Modern Talking\'s songs that Dieter Bohlen wants to refer during his upcoming concerts this year.

The artists have focused on covers of punk rock, post punk and new wave songs, with arrangements reaching for a bossa nova style.','https://goout.net/i/131/1318983-383.jpg','2025-04-11 19:00:00','2025-04-11 23:59:59',14534,5),(31794,'Las Trumien + Fiasko + Grief Circle','# Concert of the band Las Trumien in the strong company of Fiasko.\n\nLas Trumien is a crew that, as one of the few lineups on the Polish scene, successfully presents its own vision of musical filth and pathology called by critics sludge-doom.

Their stage setup has included a hurdy-gurdy, rebec, guile, lute guitar, acoustic bass guitar, flutes (classical, modified quena, baritone flute), five-stringed and baritone violins, traditional drums and percussion instruments, as well as  vocal techniques including white voice and throat singing. They are probably the first folk band to live to be listed in an encyclopaedia of rock music.\n\nŻywiołak\'s latest album, entitled *Dekonstrukcja historyczna I*, is an attempt to draw forgotten meanings from familiar holidays and show these meanings in the musical context of indigenous religion. It is also an attempt by artists to confront the highly complex subject of the legacy of Slavic mythology in Poland. *Dekonstrukcja historyczna* is an important voice on the issue of cultural social consciousness and a very strong discourse on the condition of Polish identity, carried out invariably since the band\'s first album.','https://goout.net/i/113/1134349-383.jpg','2024-12-14 20:00:00','2024-12-14 23:59:59',14583,5),(31849,'Czarodziej','Great musical setting, colorful costumes and above all, many amazing, magical impressions.

He was distinguished by an excellent sense of observation and an ability to remember the most fleeting impressions, which he then recorded on canvas.\n\nThe layout of the exhibition will reflect the most important areas of Chełmoński\'s interest in painting: it will show him as a chronicler of everyday village life, an artist fascinated by horses, their beauty, character, spontaneous dynamics of movement, and finally as a sensitive observer of nature, noting also the spiritual, religious and mystical dimension of its being. Designed in this way, the exhibition will provide an opportunity to take a new, critical look at Chełmoński\'s painting.\n\nThe exhibition is the culmination of a research project carried out jointly by the National Museums in Warsaw, Poznań and Kraków.

In 1984, Bobby Franklin (vocals), John Ruth (guitar), Chuck Jones (guitar), Jeff Boydston (bass) and Bill Jones (drums) recorded their self-titled EP, a snapshot of the heyday of US power metal. After several line-up changes, the group broke up 1992; however, the EP gained cult status in underground circles overseas, leading to a brief reunion in 2004, as well as the release of archival compilation *The Dungeon Tapes*. Bobby Franklin reformed the group once again in 2011; the reunited Medieval Steel has released two albums of new music since, *Dark Castle* (2014) and *Gods of Steel* (2024).\n\nThe second item on the bill is the British band Toranaga. Forging together in the UK metal scene of the late-\'80s, Toranaga was a band that seemed destined for big things. Not only was their bridging of thrash with traditionally-flavored heavy metal songwriting instantly irresistible, they also had the major label muscle of Chrysalis Records behind them. After their sophomore record *God\'s Gift* received some airplay but failed to take off, the band became increasingly unhappy with Chrysalis. With other problems surrounding the band, Toranaga parted company with the label by the end of 1991.

Such an unusual description sums up the freedom with which the Swedish band plays with contrasts. Their melodic death metal is not meant to be melodic for the sake of being melodic, as the band\'s main goal is to write memorable songs in the first place.\n\nPain is for people who dream of metal, but in a strongly party form - not silly, not ironic by force, but danceable.

Coming from a dilapidated industrial centre in the heart of Poland, famous for its film school and once thriving film industry, where graffiti oozes from the walls and David Lynch feels at home, they simply had to boldly go where no one had gone before... and they did so with a vengeance and a determination to set trends. Always ahead of other bands in their native Poland, they instantly became the *rebellious voice of Polish twenty-somethings*. In a world of over-stylized, overproduced and exaggerated music products, they are a bit of a rarity.

And you are an attraction for me, without you I would feel at home, lonely and unnecessary*. And this is actually the only recurring part of the evening. What follows after the greeting is also a mystery to Baltroczyk. Invigilated by an overbearing journalist, and he is sensitive to overbearingness, he once confessed that he has about 7 hours of monologue in his head, and it is a constant mystery to him what the Stage Baltroczyk will choose from the secret drawers of his mind. They are still an enigma to each other, Baltroczyk Estradowy and Baltroczyk Ordinary, and this, perhaps, keeps one and the other in high combat prowess, despite the lousy peselos they share. What hasn\'t changed over the years is his negative attitude toward suits, which he treats as a professional necessary evil; and his idolatrous one toward heavy motorcycles, which he rides on long trips. He worships paintings by Jan Stanislawski and acoustic guitars made of precious wood, whose makers were also Masters. There are many things that interest Baltroczyk, from wooden construction in his beloved Warmia, to new putty techniques, to pick-ups in Telecasters. And all of this is an inspiration. And so new fragments of the national epic continue to emerge. Another version of Piotr Bałtroczyk\'s story.

The music here meanders between prog-pop, alt-disco and psychedelic improvisation, while the lyrics bind the whole thing together in an emotion-filled, personal message. Half of the album was recorded *on the hundred*, which adds to the material\'s authenticity and vibrancy. King of the Sun has been promoting the album since the beginning of the year. So far, five singles have been released: *Last Chance*, *Now*, *Zero Zero*, *Jupiter* and *Breathe Again*. They have hit the airwaves on over a dozen radio stations, major playlists and blogs. This interest also resulted in numerous interviews, preparing the ground for the release of the debut album.\n\nThe band was formed in 2020 in Warsaw thanks to a meeting of producers and musicians Alik Matuszewski and Eryk Sarniak. In time, the duo was joined by Maciek Sobczyński (guitar) and Artur Pasco (drums). Operating completely independently, the group has so far released over a dozen singles and developed a distinctive sound.\n\nMadame Affair are Poznań-based groove freaks. Tight beats, blistering riffs and cheeky bass are the base they betray right and left. The result of this love affair is the distinctiveness of each song.

Another important theme in the exhibition is the cultural significance of photography—how it has been used to convey knowledge about the world, but also to influence public opinion. The whole exhibition will conclude with a piece about the future of photography—about contemporary imaging techniques using photographs or how artists and artists are responding to the transformation of the world (and technology).\n\nThe exhibition consists of around 1,000 museum artefacts from the collections of the Museum of Photography in Krakow - photographic prints and albums, glass plates, negatives and photographic equipment.

In the narratives accompanying the exhibition, the curatorial team – Jerzy Hanusek, Kamil Kuitkowski and Natalia Zarzecka – has as a primary goal to bring one of Poland\'s most important artists closer to contemporary audiences, which is to be achieved by juxtaposing the themes and contexts in which and against which he worked, and which still prove to be relevant today. Bereś, as a rebellious artist, contesting aesthetic, social and political orders, makes it possible to read himself anew, both in the face of current political situations and post-anthropocentric trends, questioning the hitherto (superior) position of man in the world.\n\nFinally, the \"Bereś\" exhibition will explore exhibition models in addition to the art of the artist who remains in its title, treating the exhibition itself as a starting point for further activities. In this case, it will be an elaborate performative accompanying and accessibility program – based, in accordance with the artist\'s original intentions, on the possibility of establishing a direct relationship with some of the objects by touching and setting them in motion. Also, the layout of the exhibition will undergo changes during its duration. In addition, the program will address conservation problems concerning the preservation and reconstruction of the sculptures, as well as action after the artist\'s death – it will include the assembly of selected works by Bereś with the participation of the public, and a reenactment of *Romantic Manifestation* will also take place in Krakow\'s Main Square.\n\nThe event at Cricoteka will be accompanied by a catalog with photographic documentation of the exhibition and texts by Magdalena Ujma, Marta Smolińska, Krzysztof Siatka and the curators, as well as a memoir book by the artist\'s daughter, Bettina Bereś, *Awangarda między kuchnią a łazienką* (a collaboration between the Universitas publishing house, the Maria Pinińska-Bereś and Jerzy Bereś Foundation and Cricoteka).','https://goout.net/i/126/1268539-383.jpg','2024-03-20 12:00:01','2024-12-08 23:59:00',14613,6),(31962,'Joanna Rajkowska: Night Herons','Joanna Rajkowska\'s first solo exhibition at lokal_30 explores the theme of nature as a silent witness to history. Its narrative revolves around the marionette film Blinders by Joanna Rajkowska and Robert Yerachmiel Sniderman, in which past and present intermingle in an attempt at redemption for atrocities committed against animals and humans, while showing the bond between humans and non-human actors jointly experiencing war, cruelty and suffering. The authors draw on the idea of posthumanism - a philosophical current that contests the concept of man as the measure of all things and rejects an object-oriented approach to nature. At the same time, Rajkowska diagnoses a multi-level global crisis - climate-related, humanitarian, human-rights-related, political, and above all related to the breakdown of the hierarchy of values, an unprocessed trauma that turns the iconic victim into a ruthless oppressor.','https://goout.net/i/130/1300319-383.jpg','2024-09-26 12:00:01','2024-11-30 23:59:00',14614,6),(31963,'Ewa Kuryluk: Memory Machine','The exhibition *Memory Machine* at Stalowa Gallery recalls Ewa Kuryluk\'s works from 1981-1990, when the artist lived in the United States.

They have previously looked at themes such as history, sport, economics, crime, gender, medicine, motherland, art, nature and politics. Food in this context has an exceptional position, since it is crucial to existence itself, which lends it significance in many areas of our lives.\n\nFood is indispensable for satisfying one of the physiological needs at the very base of Maslow’s pyramid of the hierarchy of human needs – yet, in parallel – also a number of other of the higher order ones, psychological and social, such as a sense of social belonging or security. Vital for survival, food has shaped our civilisation. It has served as payment for labour; the process of its acquisition has powered the engine of progress. It was the search of food that triggered the migrations of peoples and thus led to the discovery of the world. Food scarcity has given rise to conflicts and contributed to social upheaval and bloodshed. To this day, food accompanies rituals and ceremonies and is the foundation of every community, culture and religion.\n\nThe exhibition will present the work of 66 artists from many different countries, exploring a variety of media such as painting, photography, video, object and installation. Taking part in a meal is a social activity, lays a basis for our identity and can serve as a tool of resistance. Contemporary artists take on board both the problems resulting from scarcity as well as those from an excess of food. The former can result in hunger and starvation, causing social inequality and individual indignity and leading to humanitarian crises and large-scale devastation; the latter manifest themselves in rampant or indeed debauched consumerism, accompanied by waste and the detrimental health effects of pursuing a poor-quality diet. Artists will analyse both the aesthetic potential of food, which art has explored for centuries as well as its ethical and philosophical dimensions.\n\n**artists:** Jonathan Baldock, Krzysztof M.

The authors intend the exhibition to show Dabrowski first and foremost as a man of complex character, whose fate and life choices have not always conformed to the Polish vision of history. He was often set as an example of a professional officer, but was also repeatedly accused of treason and careerist attitude. The famous nineteenth-century Warsaw historian Tadeusz Korzon, who attacked Dabrowski, admitted that the latter \"never broke down; he may have wandered astray at times, looked for ways either too gambling or too compromising for our nation (...), but he looked for them always and everywhere, always ready to work, to devise a project.\" Therefore, the upcoming temporary exhibition and accompanying educational program will not only present the figure of the general, but also encourage individual exploration of questions about the contemporary meaning of the word patriotism.\n\nThe aim of the exhibition is to slightly \"de-brindle\" Jan Henryk Dabrowski, who had to make difficult choices during his life, often facing criticism from his compatriots. One of the main accusations was that Dabrowski did not speak Polish well and was maliciously referred to as a \"German\" because of his German way of life. Poles accused him of an aversion to liquor, a stodgy and demanding manner, servility and too much adherence to discipline.\n\nThere are many threads in his biography that testify to the complexity of his character. He was known for thinking in military terms, excelled in constructing plans and organizations, and at the same time wrote love letters to his wife Lila. He wanted to establish himself materially, craved fame and promotion, but supported those in need and demanded a lot from himself, improving his professional skills on his own. He showed great commitment to military plans often at the risk of his life, which translated into undoubted military merit. Eventually, feeling unappreciated, removed from high positions, but also suffering from wounds, he withdrew to Winna Gora. In the opinion of modern historians, Dabrowski\'s activity is assessed positively, nevertheless he was not a crystalline figure, because like any hero we like to idealize, he was first and foremost a human being.\n\nVisitors to the Winna Gora exhibition will be invited to discover the interesting biography of Dabrowski presented in a form visually reminiscent of a board game. The direction of movement through the exhibition is determined by successive fields, where new events and new characters related to the history of the general\'s life will appear. Some of them will encourage you to stop longer and look at period relics, while others will encourage you to do simple activities, such as arranging pillow fortifications or trying on elements of the Polish legionaries\' costumes. There will also be the voice of Dabrowski himself, who liked to describe his military achievements, but also to return in memory to moments spent in his hometown. You will be able to hear him in a radio play specially created for the exhibition. Visitors will be provided with a printed guide - a blueprint for this historical showdown - encouraging, among other things, visitors to put themselves in the role of the general and make important decisions on his behalf related to their duties to their homeland, in the spirit of responsibility for family, professional ambition, honor, discipline or respect for tradition.\n\n**assistant curator:** Robert Jędrzejczak\\\n**co-author of curatorial text:** Kacper Strzelecki\\\n**exhibition design:** Karol Pawełek, YOS Studio\\\n**educational aid authors:** Katarzyna Niewczas, Maria Pawlak\\\n**listener guide:** Ewa Kaczmarek, Jarosław Mikołajczyk\n\n**partners:** Hero Collection, Ośrodek Doskonalenia Nauczycieli w Poznaniu, Koleje Wielkopolskie\\\n**media partner:** Kultura u Podstaw\\\n**list of lending institutions and collectors:** Museum of Clothing History in Poznań, Napoleonic Museum in Witaszyce, National Museum in Poznań, St. Staszic Regional Museum in Piła, Museum of Polish Arms in Kołobrzeg, Museum of the Origins of the Polish State in Gniezno, Regional Museum in Człuchów, Regional Museum in Szczecinek, Stanislaw Staszic Museum in Piła, Opalinski Castle Museum in Sieraków, Hero Collection, Krzysztof Komaniecki\\\n**iconographic sources:** Ossolineum Institute, Museum of the National Anthem in Będomin, polona.pl (public domain)\n\n**The exhibition was co-financed by the Wielkopolska Voivodeship.**','https://goout.net/i/125/1255734-383.jpg','2023-12-01 12:00:01','2024-12-31 23:59:00',14627,5),(31985,'Gift voucher','','https://goout.net/i/083/836054-383.jpg','2024-05-16 17:27:20','2025-05-16 17:27:20',14628,5),(31986,'Organic Festival 2025','During the four days of the festival, you will be transported back in time to the 60s and 70s, to sunny climes, full of the benefits of nature.

The exhibition presents his figure holistically against the background of the fate of Poland and Europe. Wybicki is presented not only as a poet, but also as a politician, lawyer, general or innovator, and above all as an ardent patriot. The venue of the exhibition is the oldest part of Wybicki\'s Manor (this is where the author of the anthem was born in 1747). The historical interiors showcase old furniture and numerous memorabilia bearing witness to the history of the building. On display in the place of honour is a facsimile of the manuscript of *Song of the Polish Legions in Italy* (the anthem\'s original version). The original manuscript was lost during the Second World War; today it is probably in Russia. The most valuable, and at the same time the most interesting objects include: decorations—the contemporary Order of the White Eagle and the Order of the Legion of Honour 1852–1870, a portrait of Prince Józef Poniatowski, letters of Józef Wybicki and a collection of patriotic song books.

The co-founder of Nightwish has enchanted the whole world with her soprano, and combining it with turn-of-the-century metal has resulted in a new genre that has inspired many bands. In 2006, Tarja embarked on a solo career and has stuck to this path ever since. For almost 20 years now, she has released a total of nine solo albums, on which she has taken both classical and rock directions.\n\nMarko Hietala spent 2 decades in Nightwish and parted ways with the band in 2021. During this time, the bassist and vocalist was still (with a small break) an important part of the Tarot line-up, working additionally with Delain or Amorphis, among others, until he finally decided to focus on his solo career. The result? The disc *Pyre of Black Heart*, the Finnish version of which was released in 2019 and the English-language version a year later. Marko continues his journey, and the best evidence of this is the co-recorded track *Left on Mars* with Tarja, which saw the light of day in mid-March. It is sure to be heard at concerts in Warsaw, Krakow and Wroclaw, just like the duo\'s jointly performed tracks from Nightwish\'s repertoire.','https://goout.net/i/128/1289046-383.jpg','2025-03-01 19:00:00','2025-03-01 23:59:59',14534,5),(31991,'Tokio Hotel','#### Noughts icons Tokio Hotel return to Poland with a concert at Warsaw\'s Progresja.\n\\\nThe pop/rock quartet Tokio Hotel emerged in 2005 as one of the most successful German acts of their generation. At the height of their career, they were Europe\'s premiere teen hearttrobs, magnets for controversy and favorite subject of media ridicule: loved and hated for their emo-meets-pop sound and the androgynous, flamboyant style of frontman Bill Kaulitz. Founded by Bill and his twin brother Tom Kaulitz in 2001 when they were only 12 years old, Tokio Hotel\'s national big break came with 2005\'s debut album *Schrei*; they broke into the international market with 2007\'s English-language debut *Scream*, starting a career that included 10 million album sales and 110 awards, including two MTV VMAs.

Astatke\'s work – some released in the US, some in the UK, some on the pioneering Ethiopian imprint Amha Records – became renowned among record collectors in the years to come, leading to high-profile reissues (like 1998\'s *Éthiopiques 4* and 2009\'s *New York–Addis–London*), widespread sampling and extensive touring.

The Gdańsk-born rapper, who was active as early as the late 2000s, has over the course of more than a decade evolved from the strictly street style of his earlier productions to a highly successful modern trap style infused with pop and club influences. Now, his catchy songs can be heard everywhere: from probably the majority of house parties in the country, to sold-out solo concerts and the biggest Polish festivals.

This unique event will allow fans to relive the magic of their music and also see the bands Frontside and Hostia.\n\nIllusion are undoubtedly one of the most important rock bands in Poland. Their history dates back to 1992, when, in Gdańsk, former She and Skawalker musician Tomasz ‘Lipa’ Lipnicki, Jerzy ‘Jerry’ Rutkowski and Paweł Herbasch founded the band. The first Illusion concert took place in February 1992 in Gdańsk, and already in August of the same year, Jarosław Śmigiel joined them. In this line-up, the band functions to this day. Illusion\'s debut album was released in 1993, which featured vocalist Grzegorz ‘Guzik’ Guziński and guitarist Janusz Sokołowski as guests. Illusion concerts are invariably hugely popular. The band is known for their energetic performances, which infect the audience with an incredible dose of rock energy. During the upcoming tour, fans will have the opportunity to hear them in cities such as Warsaw, Krakow and Poznań.\n\nThe upcoming tour will also be special for fans of the band Frontside, who will be reminding fans of their third album *The Twilight of the Gods - First Step to a Mental Revolution*. This album premiered in October 2004 and this year celebrates its 20th anniversary. To celebrate, Mystic Production will reissue this classic release on CD and for the first time as an LP. One of Frontside\'s most recognisable songs - *Our Destiny is to Burn* - comes from this album. During the tour, Frontside will present a set based on this iconic album, but without forgetting other key songs from throughout their career. The band, known for their dynamic live shows, has this time prepared a completely new setlist that is sure to delight both regular fans and new listeners.\n\nHostia is a Polish revelation of recent years on the grindcore scene. Known for their brutal, uncompromising songs, the band quickly won the hearts of heavy sound lovers. Their music combines fast, aggressive sounds with a rocking groove and catchy patents hidden under a layer of noise. Hostia have released one EP and three full-length albums, the latest of which *Nailed* was released in November 2022 on Deformeathing Productions.','https://goout.net/i/099/999227-383.jpg','2024-12-13 19:00:00','2024-12-13 23:59:59',14665,5),(32098,'Dziwna Wiosna','Dziwna Wiosna is going on tour.

It was started by musician Robert Jaworski – then known for his work with folk staple Warsaw Village Band, among others – who, alongside Open Folk guitarist Robert Wasilewski, weaved threads of Polish folk demonology, Slavic folk music and the madness of experimental musicking. These foundations have led to a deeply idiosyncratic and recognisable sound. Their stage setup has included a hurdy-gurdy, rebec, guile, lute guitar, acoustic bass guitar, flutes (classical, modified quena, baritone flute), five-stringed and baritone violins, traditional drums and percussion instruments, as well as  vocal techniques including white voice and throat singing. They are probably the first folk band to live to be listed in an encyclopaedia of rock music.\n\nŻywiołak\'s latest album, entitled * Dekonstrukcja historyczna I*, is an attempt to draw forgotten meanings from familiar holidays and show these meanings in the musical context of indigenous religion. It is also an attempt by artists to confront the highly complex subject of the legacy of Slavic mythology in Poland. *Dekonstrukcja historyczna* is an important voice on the issue of cultural social consciousness and a very strong discourse on the condition of Polish identity, carried out invariably since the band\'s first album.','https://goout.net/i/113/1134349-383.jpg','2024-12-13 20:00:00','2024-12-13 23:59:59',14666,5),(32100,'Kizo & Bletka','# It\'s time for the Patopop Tour.

The Gdańsk-born rapper, who was active as early as the late 2000s, has over the course of more than a decade evolved from the strictly street style of his earlier productions to a highly successful modern trap style infused with pop and club influences. Now, his catchy songs can be heard everywhere: from probably the majority of house parties in the country, to sold-out solo concerts and the biggest Polish festivals. Bletka is a Polish singer and songwriter. Her music career took off in February 2023, when she released her debut single *Teraz wiem*.

Since 2000, they have released 10 albums maintained in a peri-hip-hop style. They made a name for themselves in Polish hip-hop by introducing eclectic sounds and lyrics full of humor and characteristic melancholy, at one time alluding to the climate of Native Tongues. From then until now, the brothers have been constantly experimenting, but trying to ensure that all their inventions have one ingredient in common - high quality and commitment. Their latest album, *Ballads and Protests*, is a strong return to the roots of the band\'s musical journey - to the 1990s, when the so-called music of the city - hip-hop or electronica - was developing. It\'s a sentimental story about the sounds that inspired and pointed the way of exploration. But above all, it\'s a record of defiance. Full of disagreement with infantile, aggressive, black-and-white politics, with the bypassing in public life of such important topics as human rights or climate change. And, as always with Fisz, it\'s all conveyed in strong lyrics, full of irony, a focus on the world rushing to nowhere, insightful glimpses into the depths of a guest lost in the chaos of inevitable change.','https://goout.net/i/116/1166937-383.jpg','2025-03-28 20:00:00','2025-03-28 23:59:59',14533,5),(32157,'Recepta na szczęście','# Musical romantic comedy with live music.\n\nThree generations of women meet in a doctor\'s office: love-seeking Kasia, who is just beginning her adult life in the big city; Kleo, a middle-aged woman in despair, abandoned by her husband; and senior citizen Gina, who dislikes loneliness and has recently enrolled in the \"Adult Singles\" club, where she was chosen \"Girl of the Year.\" All the ladies have their own needs, dreams of love and plans. They all treat the doctor more as a psychologist or confidant of their thoughts than as a doctor. Dr. Kazimierz is known for his ability to heal not only the body, but also the soul, and is very dedicated to his patients. A mysterious country-man patient who lives in the countryside and loves nature and living close to it also appears in the office. The meeting of all the characters, the clash of their different worlds, creates a veritable storm in the Doctor\'s office and leads to an unexpected ending.

What\'s more, the program will feature all-new music from Glenn\'s upcoming solo album, scheduled for release in the summer of 2025.

On the other hand, the first major band of which Hughes was a member, and which achieved significant success, was Trapeze. Since 1992, Hughes has toured extensively in Europe, Japan and South America, promoting solo albums, but more recently he has been associated with the supergroup Black Country Communion, in which he performs with guitarist Joe Bonamassa, keyboardist Derek Sherinian (Dream Theater) and drummer Jason Bonham, son of the late Led Zeppelin legend John Bonham. In 2016 he released his critically acclaimed solo album *Resonate* featuring the rock radio hit *Heavy*, and 2017 saw the release of Black Country Communion\'s fourth studio album *BCCIV*, which was met with rave reviews, (another *V* will be released next June).

We were faced with the call to select pieces from a massive pool of works in our possession and we did so with a view to offering visitors an image of 19th century art that is pertinent to today’s audiences. An intensity of artistic issues, overlapping styles, and Poland’s unique historical experiences all complicated our challenge to arrange works in a way that would demonstrate not only the ties between Polish and European art, but also difficulties in accepting new directions, and a peculiar type of conservatism. All of this is worth remembering when touring the new exhibition in the Gallery of 19th Century Art – interpreting the creative message of artists and their works anew, in the here and now.','https://goout.net/i/037/372482-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14597,6),(32173,'The Pemanent Exhibition of The Muzeum Nurkowania','Not many people know about the divers\' role in the clean out of the Niemen river that allowed it to become an alternative to Vistula route of transporting goods to the Polish seaside.

The exhibition is primarily a story about Kraków and its inhabitants, both Polish and Jewish, during World War Two. It is also a story about Nazi Germans – the occupiers who arrived here on 6 September 1939, brutally disrupting Kraków’s centuries-long history of Polish-Jewish relations. The great history of World War Two intersects here with everyday life, and the personal dramas of individual people overlap with the tragedy which affected the whole world.\n\nThe wartime history of Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik – DEF – and its owner Oskar Schindler was brought into the limelight in 1993 by Steven Spielberg’s film Schindler’s List. Ever since that time, tourists from all over the world have been coming to Lipowa Street to visit the place where Schindler saved the lives of over a thousand people. The character of Oskar Schindler and the life stories of the Kraków Jews he saved are presented in the exhibition as part of the city’s complex wartime history. Oskar Schindler’s heroic attitude is presented in close-up in his former office – luckily, the historic room located in the factory’s administrative building has been preserved intact throughout the years. The dominant feature here is the symbolic “Survivors’ Ark” made of thousands of enamelled pots, similar to those manufactured by Schindler’s employees during the war.\n\nThe exhibition scenario was prepared by a team of Kraków-based specialists (Katarzyna Zimmerer, Grzegorz Jeżowski, Edyta Gawron and Barbara Zbroja) headed by the curator of the exhibition Monika Bednarek. The narrative created by that team combines documentary photographs, eyewitness accounts, film documentaries and multimedia presentations. All of these elements are put together to make a vivid, chronological vision of the city’s history. The exhibition presents the tragedy of the war both in the individual, and in the collective dimension, but it also portrays everyday life in the Nazi-occupied Kraków as it is immortalized in ordinary objects, photographs, newspapers, personal and official documents.','https://goout.net/i/059/595595-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14700,5),(32183,'The Legacy Gallery','The Legacy gallery, an extension of the Core Exhibition of POLIN Museum, explores the lives and achievements of such outstanding individuals as Julian Tuwim, David Ben-Gurion, Arthur Rubinstein, Rosa Luxemburg, Raphael Lemkin, Ludwig Zamenhof, and Helena Rubenstein, among many others. Visitors are invited to reflect on how the lives and achievements of these individuals illuminate the history of Polish Jews, and how the history of Polish Jews helps us better understand who they became, what they accomplished, and their impact on Polish, Jewish, and world civilization.\n\nThe twenty-six individuals featured in the Legacy gallery represent creative achievement in many fields: art, literature, music, film, theatre, science and the humanities, law, education, economics, politics. Their biographies also testify to the diversity of their life experience and to the complex relations between Polish and Jewish worlds. All of them were born in Poland or in Polish lands; most of them grew up in Poland. Some were raised in religious families, others in acculturated or assimilated ones, and some converted. Some stayed in Poland, while others left. That said, the fact that they were born and bred in a world of Polish Jewish values had an impact, to a greater or lesser degree, on their life choices. This constellation of luminaries forms a collective portrait of Polish Jews in all their diversity, as seen through the prism of the lives and achievements of individuals who are at once exceptional and representative. Their biographies and careers were shaped at the crossroads of many cultures, which made them particularly open to the world.

Yet such division did not exist in the past. Generally speaking, all art forms were perceived as equal. If any of them was considered superior, it was not painting or sculpture but goldsmithery and tapestry weaving. The very notion of art – Latin ars (followed by Italian arte and French art), Greek techne, German and Dutch Kunst – originally signified artistry, skillful execution, craft. What was most highly esteemed in painting and sculpture was exactly artisanal expertise, virtuosity of workmanship.','https://goout.net/i/094/945514-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2030-05-05 02:00:59',14597,6),(32197,'Celebration Time','A story about rituals, traditions, and objects that belong to different traditions and denominations in Poland and Europe takes up over 850 m² and it is told through thousands of exhibits.

It puts the traditionally understood notions of “folk” and “rustic” in a new context.\n\nThe folk “costume” is the key to the Celebration Time exhibition – a unique set of clothes worn for a feast that involves dancing, music, and rituals. Therefore, the exhibition aims to emphasise the variety of folk costumes by presenting over 100 festive outfits from Poland and Europe as well as a unique in the world collection of European folk dance models with miniature dancers wearing traditional folk costumes. The models were created for the International Exposition of Art and Technology in Modern Life held in Paris in 1937.\n\nWhile presenting tradition, the exhibition also asks about the importance of folk style in mass culture and reveals the influence of folklore on fashion and applied arts, since the 1930s to our times. A gallery with folk instruments from Poland and other countries allows visitors to listen to now forgotten sounds of the sarangi, gadulki, or bandura.

One of the most valuable objects is a gold mask (protoma) in the shape of a bull\'s head from Iran. It also presents monumental antique marble sculptures . One of the halls is filled with relics of sophisticated Greek vase painting. Here you will be able to admire, among others, a vessel with the image of the poetess Safona. The exhibition demonstrates the links between ancient cultures and tells the story of the reception of antiquity in modern times. The character of the new Ancient Art Gallery is created by the play of light and shadow. The bright colors of the walls evoke images of desert sand and the Egyptian sun. Illuminated spaces are juxtaposed with dark halls reminiscent of the interiors of ancient tombs and Roman catacombs. The greatest achievements of Polish archaeology are connected with Professor Kazimierz Michałowski (1901-1981), who was associated with the Museum of the History of Polish Jews and Warsaw University. The scientist led many archaeological missions in Europe and Africa. The Gallery of Ancient Art will display artefacts discovered during excavations carried out by Polish archaeologists in Edfu (1937-1938), Myrmekion (1950s), Tell al-Atrib (work begun in the 1950s) and Faras (1961-1964), directed by Prof. Michałowski.

However, it was also the time of increased creativity and resourcefulness. Although the quality of the gastronomy, including subsidized milk bars, left much to be desired, social, artistic and literary life thrived in cafes. Supply shortages left stores empty, but queues would line up anyway. What is at your fingertips today, was inaccessible to an ordinary citizen of the PRL.

The collection of over 60 paintings from the 8th to 14th centuries came from the cathedral in the city of Faras, a large urban centre in the Medieval kingdom of Nobadia, in present-day Sudan. Nobadian rulers controlling the Nile Valley from the first to the third cataracts converted to Christianity around 548 AD influenced by missionaries sent from Constantinople by the Empress Theodora. The first cathedral was erected in the 7th century, when the city was still known as Pachoras, and likely stood at the exact site where Polish archaeologists taking part in the Nubia Campaign discovered the subsequent 8th century cathedral.\n\nThe Nubia Campaign was an extensive international mission to preserve ancient legacies threatened by flooding from the imminent construction of the Aswan High Dam in Egypt and the resulting formation of the artificial reservoir, Lake Nasser. The paintings discovered by the Polish archaeological team working in Faras were executed on the plaster walls of the cathedral with tempera paint. After their discovery, they were painstakingly removed from the cathedral walls and since 1972 have been on display along with decorative architectural elements from the cathedral and churches and structures in Faras. Epitaphs of local clergymen and other priceless artefacts from the area, including ceramic pottery produced in local workshops, are also displayed.\n\nIn the gallery’s new layout, artefacts from the original church, erected in the 1st quarter of the 7th century at the site where the future cathedral would be built one hundred years later, will be on view in the first section of the exhibition space, near the entrance. This is also where a scale model of the cathedral will allow visitors to become familiar with the architecture and the topographical arrangement of the paintings residing in the museum’s collection.

The stories tell about the past, about how these continents were seen through the prism of collections created in the 19th and 20th century. On the two floors of the museum\'s galleries we show almost 1300 objects. One of the newly opened galleries is dedicated to Asia, the other, named after Leopold Janikowski, to Africa. In both of them you can find unique exhibits, but also learn about history through multimedia stations.\n\nLeopold Janikowski, after whom the African gallery is named, was one of those Polish Africanists who wanted to get to know and understand the continent distant from Poland. This Polish traveller exploring Africa was connected with the State Ethnographic Museum in Warsaw. It was him who organized the first ethnographic exhibition devoted to Africa in Warsaw in the late 19th century. His and other Poles\' presence on the continent was different from that of their European contemporaries. In this part we can look at objects connected with power and magic, kings and sorcerers are important figures of the gallery.\n\nAsian routes have been traversed by wanderers for centuries. It is the ambition of the Asian Gallery to show not only their geographical but sometimes mystical journeys. The Buddhism of the Small, Great and Diamond Way, the path of the center, the way of knowledge, the way of battle, the way of the sword and bow, the way of tea, the way of flowers – they can be found in our exhibition.

A visit to their atelier, combined with long and tiring posing, was more like torture than the joyful fun we associate with the activity of photography today. From the moment the invention of photography was announced in 1839, photography progressed rapidly and the number of photographers grew exponentially. Over time, a completely new relationship developed between the photographer and the photographed, in which the original oppression gave way to mutual fascination, often with a distinctly erotic tinge. The balance of power was fluid and negotiable every time.\n\nIn the 20th century anyone could be a photographer and the aesthetics of photography also changed. Loosening old patterns and progressing freedom of frames were connected with mass appearance of non-professional photographers. It was supposed to cause a drop in the level of photography, but in fact it contributed to the enrichment of its means of expression. At the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, professionals even began to consciously use the aesthetics of error typical of amateur photography. While in the past photographs were created to commemorate reality, nowadays the act of taking pictures often seems to be oriented towards the author\'s immediate \"promotion\".

I suspect that objects do this for educational reasons, in order to constantly reproach us for our unsteadiness*, Zbigniew Herbert wrote. As in Herbert\'s poem, only objects remain unchanged in the permanent exhibition at the Ethnographic Museum in Krakow. Created several decades ago, the exhibition presents various aspects of the past world of the countryside. Since then, it has been subject to constant reinterpretation. Looking at the objects presented in the exhibition, successive generations of museum professionals and visitors have tried again and again to find an answer to the question: *How does a person organise their reality?*\n\nThe artefacts, which come from various ethnographic regions of Poland, are grouped into micro-stories about the successive stages of man\'s life, his relationship to nature, work, home, creativity, religion, ritual and to the other person. The permanent exhibition can thus be approached holistically or fragmentarily—taking in specific objects. The museum offers four perspectives: *Inside, The Rhythm of Life, Human Objects* and *Unattainable Earth*, without, however, placing a full stop. It opens up space for new interpretations and allowing things to act—to delight, inspire, remember and reproach.','https://goout.net/i/114/1149056-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14731,6),(32239,'Gabinet Wolski','The story of Wola is weaved from socio-political, cultural and personal stories.

Thus, the Wola Study is an auteur’s look at the complex history of one of the largest districts of Warsaw.

Selected museum pieces, archival materials and other artefacts correspond with them in the visual layer. Each of the proposed topics and items is accompanied by a relevant text.

They then proceed to a corridor parallel to the corridor with the isolation cells, where four multimedia stations have been placed. *Defensive War and Occupation,* this stand shows the German annexation before the outbreak of the Second World War, the defensive war in September 1939 and the division of Poland between the Third Reich and the USSR, Nazi policy in the occupied Polish territories, the elite liquidation campaign, the extermination of the Jewish population and the mass displacement of Poles.\n\n*The Road from Pawiak to Szucha* is a post depicting the road to interrogation at Szucha that almost every Pawiak prisoner travelled, sometimes repeatedly.

However, the phenomenon of realistic representation applies to all eras in the history of art. In popular perception, a faithful representation of reality is regarded as \'good art\'. However, artists are not concerned with this. They use the dialogue with real images to build their own ideas on their \'flesh\'.\n\nPeople perceive the world very similarly – it addresses everyone in the same language. Our ability to respond to this message determines our survival and understanding with others. This is why the language in which reality speaks to us is so sensitive to misrepresentation. Every change in colour, size and distance becomes strategically important and can be life-defining. Artists exploit the sensitivity of the real image and create their own languages on this basis. They soften or brutalise it, mix or deform figures, introduce touches of the absurd, exaggerate and manipulate expressions, make colours unreal... In this way, they speak in realistic language about things that have little to do with the real image. They show in their works the general sense of life, times and politics and the accompanying moods, dreams and perversions.\n\nModern art has further expanded the linguistic possibilities of realistic representation. The 20th century was a good teacher. It reworked cubism, abstraction and geometry, and introduced collage, video and computer techniques. The contemporary artist is able to extract surprising reflections from real images – on any subject. This exhibition presents works that speak in the language of realism about everything that is currently important.\n\n**Artists:** AES+F, Reza Aramesh, Alpin Arda Bağcık, Alicia Framis, Maya Gold, Debora Hirsch, Suzanne Husky, Krištof Kintera, Muntean/Rosenblum, Hans Op de Beeck, Julian Opie, Yigal Ozeri, Štefan Papčo, Deborah Sengl, Daniel Spoerri, Toni R.

The three-metre-high granite monolith, bearing the inscriptions of three rulers of the 19th dynasty, is a unique object. It is the only Pharaonic obelisk in Poland and one of very few in Europe. The obelisk is made of grey granite (granodiorite) quarried near Aswan. The side of the base of the obelisk measures approximately 53 cm, which corresponds to 1 Egyptian cubit. Its height, probably designed as just over 6 Egyptian cubits, is reduced by damage to the pyramidia (upper parts of obelisks) to 300 cm. The obelisk weighs nearly two tonnes.\n\nThe monument comes from the city of Hut-heri-ib (Gr. Athribis, now Tell Atrib, a district of the city of Benha) in the Nile Delta. It was the capital of the 10th nom of Lower Egypt. It once stood in front of the temple of the local deity Chenti-cheti, together with a second obelisk, fragments of which are preserved in the Cairo museum. Taken from Athribis, it was used as a threshold in an Arab house in Cairo and, after its discovery there, was purchased in 1895 by C. Reinhardt. Brought to Europe, it had been in the Berlin museum since 1896.\n\nThe four sides of the obelisk bear carved inscriptions with the names and titles of three rulers of the 19th dynasty: Ramses II (1279-1213 BC), Merenptah (1213-1203 BC) and Seti II (1200-1194 BC). The layout of the text is analogous on all walls, while the inscriptions differ in detail, giving different variants of the names and epithets of the pharaohs. The text of Ramses II (central column) is carved on a plane clearly lowered in relation to the wall surface, suggesting the existence of an earlier inscription, removed before Ramses decorated the obelisk. It is therefore likely that this ruler usurped the obelisk set in Athribis by one of the earlier pharaohs. The son and successor of Rameses II, Merenptah added his names to the bottom of the obelisk on either side of his father\'s text. The upper part of both side columns of the text, however, contains the titulature of Seti II. The signs depicting the god Setah, which appear in the ruler\'s name inscription, were destroyed in later times. This was linked to the growing resentment in the Late Period against this god, considered an enemy of Osiris and the patron of foreign peoples invading Egypt. The bases of both Athribis obelisks, now in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, were made of quartzite and decorated with depictions of Ramses II making offerings to local deities and two solar gods: Horakhti and Atum.','https://goout.net/i/063/639468-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14746,5),(32263,'The Mieczysław Porębski Library','#### In a side building of MOCAK, next to the reading room, there is a room in which the Mieczysław Porębski Library is exhibited.\n\\\nProfessor Mieczysław Porębski expressed his desire to donate his library to the MOCAK Museum of Contemporary Art in Krakow many years ago.

They were created during the occupation by the artist Janina Giedroyć-Wawrzynowicz for her daughter Róża, to distract the little girl from the grim reality. The exhibition is an introduction to the animated series.*\n\nIn 2010, the Warsaw Rising Museum bought a collection of 500 original paper dolls. Precisely painted on watercolour paper, the dolls show the inhabitants of one tenement house. It took the Museum many years to find an appropriate artistic form to show this collection properly. The creators of the exhibition wanted the manner of presentation to reflect the previous purpose of the figures cut out of paper – so that they would transport viewers into an extraordinarily colourful, rich world just as they did in the past. The paper dolls, which can now be seen at the exhibition, will become characters in an animated series about a family and its neighbours from a single tenement house during the occupation and the Warsaw Uprising. It will allow us to look at the world of old Warsaw through the eyes of 17-year-old Helka Malinowska and her friends.\n\nThe idea was born out of the desire to support young people, lonely during the isolation caused by the pandemic, whose reality resembled that of the occupation – classes and lectures were moved to virtual space, because it was impossible to meet safely; everyone had to cope with the constant sense of danger and fear of illness and death of people close to them. The series will tell the story of everyday life in a time of wartime ordeal by comparing it to the lives of young people today during a pandemic, just as full of fear, anxiety, danger. It will talk about how, despite the constant pressure, limitations and difficulties, even in such unfavourable conditions as the reality of the occupation, it was possible to be someone - to pursue one\'s passions and dreams, to plan, create, love and learn. Today, young people enter adulthood with a sense of uncertainty about the fate of the world and their loved ones - similar feelings were shared by their peers during World War II. Perhaps this story will help someone to realise that it is possible to emerge from a difficult situation unscathed, that it is not the end of the world – because it has happened before, extremely difficult situations did happen, but our grandparents and great-grandparents, who were young people during the occupation, did not give up, acted, created an underground state, and later fought in the name of their values in the Uprising. The form of animation was chosen because it makes it possible to tell and visualise stories that are impossible to tell in any other way. It makes it possible to show all the important emotions, events and experiences, even such as the brutality and horror of wartime.\n\nThe exhibition *Hello Helka* is a prelude to the series, an entrance ticket to this world.

He is considered to be the founder of the so-called Krakow school of landscape painting, having educated more than 70 students in his studio, while others took his advice in private classes. He painted exclusively small-scale landscapes. He approached the painting as an open form—a fragment of a larger whole. At the beginning of his career, he referred mainly to the achievements of realism. The mature phase of his oeuvre is characterised by a synthesisation of forms - at that time he used a wide colour space, under the influence of impressionism he studied the changes in light and colour effects at different times of the day, year, atmospheric conditions, and strove to capture the mood of nature. Over time he became more dynamic in his landscapes, moving towards Expressionism, and from 1900 onwards Symbolism began to dominate his work, which made it possible to express universal concepts through the depiction of nature and its elements.\n\n**concept:** Inga Kopciewicz\\\n**coordinator:**  Monika Kosteczko-Grajek','https://goout.net/i/116/1168068-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14756,5),(32278,'Folklore of Gdańsk Pomerania','#### The permanent exhibition of the Department of Ethnography of the National Museum in Gdansk concerns traditional forms of rural economy of various ethnic groups of Gdansk Pomerania: Kashubians, Kociewians, Borowians, Powiślans, Żuławians.\n\\\nThe material gathered in the exhibition makes it possible to trace the basic activities of the aforementioned ethnic groups connected with their everyday existence, such as fishing, land cultivation, animal husbandry and home food processing.

The investigations were initiated by the late Prof. Lech Krzyżaniak, for many years director of the Museum. Lech Krzyżaniak started his rock art research from the site of Tassili n\'Ajjer in Algeria, which boasts one of the largest assemblages of rock paintings in Africa and the world. The oldest images date back to probably over 10 000 years, while the youngest were made in the modern era. The work carried out in the Sefar massif allowed for documenting many amazing paintings, including the famous Great God, whose photographs are on display in the exhibition.\n\nThe research in the Dakhleh Oasis in Egypt, initiated by Lech Krzyżaniak in the mid-1980s, has been continued to this day. The Poznań mission works as part of the Dakhleh Oasis Project – an international and interdisciplinary research team. The sites with rock art discovered by the Polish researchers are rich in prehistoric engravings as well as Dynastic and later Arabic images. Particularly interesting are the Neolithic representations of women, unique in the Saharan art, possibly connected with fertility, as many of them seem to be shown as pregnant.\n\nThe third area of rock art study is the region of the 4th Nile Cataract in the Sudan. The research conducted already in the 21st century made it possible to document numerous sites with petroglyphs and to acquire several boulders with engravings, which became an additional motivation for us to create this exhibition. The artefacts, handed over to Polish researchers as a token of gratitude for their participation in the rescue research in the area of the 4th Cataract, feature mainly scenes related to pastoral activities. They are estimated to date back to the 4th and 3rd millennia BC.\n\nThanks to the cooperation of several scholarly institutions engaged in the study of eastern Saharan rock art, we can also present objects discovered at other sites, in particular in the Nile valley.

The collection was further expanded after the participation of Poznań archaeologists in the research carried out by the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto and the Southern Dongola Reach Survey by the Research Centre for the Mediterranean Archaeology and the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw. The collection of the most valuable artefacts, enriched by the deposit of unique objects from the Khartoum National Museum, allowed the Archeological Museum in Poznań to open the *Archaeology of Sudan* exhibition in 2003.\n\nIn recent years the collection has been enlarged by new acquisitions, including objects acquired by the Museum after the archaeological rescue project in the area of the fourth Cataract of the Nile.

It was the idea of professor Lech Krzyżaniak, the director of our museum for over twenty years, whose friendship with Dietrich Wildung and Sylvia Schoske, the directors of the German museums was consolidated during their joint archaeological research in Egypt and the Sudan. It resulted in 1998 in the long-term loan of over one hundred objects presented at the exhibition *Death and Life in Ancient Egypt*, which covers all periods of the Ancient Egyptian history and shows various aspects of this unique culture. In 2000 the exhibition was enriched with two royal statue heads from Munich, and in 2002 the Athribis obelisk came from Berlin to be placed in the courtyard of the Górka palace. Since then much happened; the royal heads came back to Munich and some objects from Berlin were sent back, but at the same moment new ones came to Poznań. All these masterpieces of art and crafts, displayed in the Archaeological Museum, help us to understand better the culture of Ancient Egypt, being at the same moment signs of Polish-German friendship and cultural cooperation.','https://goout.net/i/114/1149327-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14746,5),(32286,'Dar Paderewskiego','The exhibition presents more than 220 works of art and memorabilia related to Ignacy Jan Paderewski, one of the greatest Polish musicians and statesmen of the 20th century.

Musical instruments, including a Steinway & Sons piano, commemorative batons and cups with dedications from symphony orchestras remind us of Paderewski\'s musical genius, while a valuable collection of porcelain from China and Japan, worn-out travel trunks and a set of decorative souvenir spoons - of his interests and travels to various corners of the world.\n\nA glimpse into the home and family life of Helena and Ignacy Paderewski is provided by everyday objects: sophisticated tea services and crystal bowls, a silver vase from Tiffany, a typewriter, a wallet and a filigree-decorated business card holder. Even carnelian miniature figures of a hen and a cockerel are part of the story of the life of the eminent politician and musician: his wife passionately bred these animals. The exhibition also includes gifts that Paderewski received from friends and various organisations in recognition of his great talent and gratitude for his independence activities.\n\nThe objects gathered in the exhibition are a bequest from the will that Paderewski gave to the National Museum in Warsaw in 1930. This gift, a selection of which can be seen in the Museum of the Interior in Otwock Wielki, was, apart from its material and historical value, also an act of patriotism.

Ritual items, which were important to the spiritual life of the pagan inhabitants of early medieval Silesia, are displayed. Related with religion are funerary rites. Before the adoption of Christianity in the 10th century, the dominant burial rite was cremation. Urns, filled with cremated human remains, were placed on top of a barrow or a wooden pole. Christian burials resulted in the interment of the complete uncremated body. As Christianity became established, the custom of providing grave goods with the dead ended. The adoption of Christianity had a profound influence on all aspects of life, not only the spiritual one.

Consequently, rather than being grounded in a stable temporal continuum, our experience is constantly organised against an uncertain future. The conviction that time no longer runs linearly manifests itself in Edna Baud\'s painting in futuristic visions of a future world filled with machines of the industrial age. In Edna Baud\'s painting *TORCH*, we see a steam locomotive. Next to it stands a presumably female figure in a welding mask and working overalls. In her hand she holds a tool that resembles an airbrush more than a welder, which allows sheets of heavy metal to be physically fused together. The figure in the painting holds a notepad in his other hand - is he glancing at instructions on what colour to paint an existing locomotive, or perhaps - how to paint it properly, to reproduce it on a flat surface? Another of the paintings on show, *WATCHTOWER*, addresses the question of the representation of time itself. It is inspired, on the one hand, by a passage from Walter Benjamin\'s essay *On the Notion of History* (1940), in which he cites events at the time of the Paris Commune uprising (1871), when a rebellious populace shot clocks on church and palace towers. On the other, the events up to the so-called University of Texas Tower shooting - the first mass shooting in the United States, which took place in 1966.\n\nThe presentation of Edna Baud\'s latest paintings in the Ewa Opałka gallery / Together Pamoja Foundation located in the urban space of Warsaw\'s Muranów district with its pre-war and wartime ghetto context, as well as the post-war socialist realist project, makes it possible to take up the theme of the decolonisation of time in the realities of Central and Eastern Europe. The disruption and squeering of the linear understanding of time and space, and with it, the end of the modern hierarchical order and the future interacting with the past, we make a bold thesis about the possible radicalism of young figurative painting.','https://goout.net/i/120/1207458-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14774,6),(32309,'Białystok: Makieta barokowego miasta z widowiskiem multimedialnym „Wersal Północy” wśród dźwięków i świateł','The model depicts Bialystok at the time of its greatest prosperity, i.e. in the second half of the 18th century. At the time, the city was famous as one of the most beautiful magnate residences in Poland and attracted widespread admiration not only from its own countrymen, but also from foreigners. In order to recreate its appearance as faithfully as possible, archival and cartographic sources were used in the realisation.

After the outbreak of World War I the Poles living at that time on occupied territories saw a chance for independence. This period was marked by conflicts between political parties representing both the independence option and the tendency to unify with Russia liberated through revolution from the system of self-tenancy and capitalist economy. The end of the war and the nominal establishment of an independent Poland were only the beginning of the road to consolidation of its independence and establishment of favorable borders. In its original version, the exhibition was open from 2007 until the beginning of the renovation of the principal establishment in 2018. For the duration of the renovation, it was transferred to the Museum of Romanticism in Opinogóra, where it was on display until 10 November 2019. In parallel, works have been under way on its new version.\n\nAt the exhibition, which has been artistically rearranged, visitors will have the opportunity to witness all the stages of the struggle for independence in chronological order and get to know the doings of the major Polish political camps. Many exhibits have already on display between 2007 and 2018. First of all, the introductory section is to feature a collection of paintings by outstanding Polish painters, such as Jacek Malczewski, Antoni Kozakiewicz, Ludomir Benedyktowicz, Franciszek Streitt, Maksymilian Gierymski and Jan Styka. They all come from the collections of the Museum of Independence. The illuminated display cases will host a vast collection of patriotic jewellery as well as badges, medals and rectangular badges associated with the theme of the exhibition. A very important part of the exhibition is represented by memorabilia and documents secured by the Museum of Independence that relate to the peace conference in Paris in 1919. There is a manuscript of Roman Dmowski’s memorial on the Polish western border dated February 1919, handwritten in French, maps with the borders proposed by the Polish delegation, diplomatic passports of Roman Dmowski and passes authorising access to the Mirror Room of the Palace of Versailles for the signing of the peace treaty, to name but a few.

Amongst the jewellery, the long pins, bracelets, armbands, diadems and necklaces made of amber beads deserve special attention. Weapons are represented by spearheads, warhammers, daggers and swords. The artefacts belonging to another Bronze Age culture - the Lusatian culture are displayed in two chronological parts. The first part is that of the Bronze Age. The second relates to the Early Iron Age (the Hallstatt period). In several cabinets, pieces of jewellery, weaponry, tools and everyday items typical for the Lusatian culture are on display. Particular attention should be paid to a hoard from Karmino, pow. milicki, consisting of a number of bronze artefacts (e.g., sickles, axes, armbands, bracelets and chains). The artefacts discovered in Woskowice Małe, pow. namysłowski are extremely rare. These hoards include imported bronze vessels - cistae, situlae and equestrian gear. A rich collection of Hallstatt painted pottery is unique for Silesia and indicates that local potters indirectly copied patterns from Southern Europe. The visitor’s attention is brought to a small cabinet where original Silesian gold jewellery from the Bronze Age is exhibited. The issues of settlements, economy and construction methods of the Lusatian culture are illustrated by a model of the fortified settlement in Biskupin, pow. żniński. Another interesting part of the exhibition presents the beliefs and rites of the Lusatian culture. It starts with the reconstruction of several cremation burials from Słup, pow. średzki. In a few cabinets, vessels with narrative scenes, clay figurines in the shape of birds, rattles, ornitomorphic cups, sun chariots, zoomorphic vessels and horn-shaped clay vessels are displayed. The next period is the Early Iron Age Pomeranian culture. It is characterized by specific burial rites. Cremated remains were placed in pottery vessels known as face urns. Schematic human faces were sculpted on these ritual vessels. They most likely symbolized deceased individuals. Additional motifs were sometimes incised on the clay, representing jewellery, everyday items and, less frequently, weapons. Some urns also had metal necklaces, earrings or clay lids in the shape of hats. The grave goods included brooches, belt buckles, pins, necklaces and toiletry kits.','https://goout.net/i/038/381363-383.jpg','2015-01-01 12:00:00','2026-08-25 00:00:59',14771,6),(32326,'Wystawa moździerzy z kolekcji prof.

It is used both during official ceremonies and in everyday situations. One can find it in the national emblem, on plates on government buildings, in classrooms, on sports outfits, coins, and banknotes. Surprisingly, it can sometimes be found in monuments in a form slightly different than the one we are used to. The symbol has a long history, which intermingles with that of our country and nation. The goal of the exhibition is to present this fascinating history by putting it in context including people, places, and events.\n\nThe new layout of the permanent exhibition *Together with the White Eagle through the Ages* is especially designed for two representative rooms on the first floor of the Przebendowski Palace. The natural spatial division of the exhibition into two parts was employed to develop a clear subject-matter and utility concept. The first room addresses, in a chronological fashion, the earlier period (up to 1795), whereas the second one the later years, which are of particular interest to the Museum in terms of\ngathering collections. In the second room, visitors will find numerous items from the institution’s own collection. The first room, which addresses the topics presented mainly using reproductions, mock-ups, and installations, will also be used for educational activities, arts workshops, and cultural events. The adopted division enabled the exhibition to fulfil many functions, for example serve as a place for presenting the collections or conducting educational classes and workshops.\n\nThe gathered materials are divided into thematic groups whose aim is to present the most important content and events related to the White Eagle. One can differentiate between individual thematic paths: the emblem’s function, the message, and the style of the image. The exhibition covers the times of legends, the pre-heraldic period, the moment of adopting the White Eagle as emblem of the Kingdom, the use of the symbol by ruling dynasties and elected kings, and finally the period when the emblem symbolised a nation without a sovereign state, the democratic efforts, and the reborn Poland. The scenario assumes that visitors not only receive a certain amount of information, but are also encouraged to actively and independently seek it. This can be achieved thanks to manual installations and multimedia elements, whose task is to bring up a particular problem and leave it up to the visitor to address it. Creators of the exhibition also tried to align the exhibition, to a largest extent possible, with the core curricula of Polish schools. Particular emphasis was put on enabling visually challenged people to appreciate the exhibition. Thanks to an audio description system and numerous elements experienced manually, the content can be appreciated without using eyes. The concept of the exhibition, developed by artist Elżbieta Jadwiga Kaszuba, provides for an open space arrangement with irregular walls, which have been extended with wings to present detailed topics.','https://goout.net/i/097/979103-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14779,5),(32328,'Permanent exhibition of the Korczakianum ','The main exhibition of the Korczakianum is placed in the main hall of the former Orphan Home – a building which has remained unchanged since the World War II.

The exhibition begins with the issue of Celtic settlements in Silesia. A Celtic warrior\'s burial reconstruction is on display. The skeleton is accompanied by numerous grave goods such as weapons and jewellery. The other artefacts associated with the Celtic culture are coins, distinctive necklaces (torcs), brooches, bracelets, amulets and clay vessels thrown on a potters\' wheel. The next few cabinets show dynamic developments in the Przeworsk culture. It is discernible in the pottery, jewellery, weaponry and everyday items. An important element in this part of the museum is the reconstruction of a cremation burial with typical grave goods - weapons, vessels, jewellery and food. An unusual inhumation burial from Ługi, pow. górowski can also be viewed in this section. A warrior with his weapons, a horse equipped with riding gear, and pottery and glass vessels were buried together in a single grave. There are two examples of chieftains\' tombs.

It expresses his overarching conviction that the surrounding reality is a text to be read. The exhibition identifies three main themes, which permeate many of his works and interpenetrate each other. They are reflections on language, time and human life. Two works are site-specific in character: one reduces text and space to a density of the world that contradicts emptiness (the so-called Lines), the other refers to a random game of dice that contrasts the chaos of throws with the order of things (*Alea iacta est*).\n\nBorn in Sławków on 15 May 1939, he died on 29 March 2009 in Wrocław, where he had lived since 1955. The most outstanding Polish concrete poet and one of the most prominent artists of the Polish avant-garde. He represented Poland at the 2003 Venice Biennale with his individual exhibition *Aleaiactaest*. In his work he moved from the “classical” form of the poem to its visual notation based on the use of single letters, punctuation marks, numbers and mathematical symbols. Over time, Stanisław Dróżdż began to expand his works into long series using mathematical algorithms (e.g. the Hourglass, whose original version was placed on MWW’s façade). He called these works *concept-shapes*, which he equated with *concrete poetry* – this is also how he titled his exhibitions.\n\nThanks to Stanisław Dróżdż, this trend, which developed around the world from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s, was still alive in Poland for another decade, and was particularly strong in Wrocław, where it brought together artists from various fields of the broadly defined arts.','https://goout.net/i/121/1210941-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14699,5),(32335,'Salon ofiarodawców','The exhibition is created by donated items.

At the time, the main centre of national artistic life in this area was Krakow, which even overshadowed the province\'s administrative capital, Lviv.

The day of November 28, 1627, holds a special place in Polish maritime tradition. It was then that a naval battle took place in the Gdansk roadstead, which went down in history as the *Battle of Oliwa*. The exhibition features striking models of the basic ships of the Polish squadron.\n\nThe collection of models *From Cog to Galleon* presents the main types of sailing ships characteristic of northern Europe – from the cog or holk, which dominated in the Middle Ages, to the great carrack *Piotr of Gdansk*, whose crew in a naval clash captured and donated to the Gdansk church the famous painting *The Last Judgment* by Hans Memling. An ornament of the collection is a model of a representative yacht/galery probably made in the early 18th century for King Augustus II the Strong.\n\nIts valuable additions are paintings by the outstanding Polish marine artist Marian Mokwa. The artist devoted a significant part of his oeuvre to Polish superiority at sea. The paintings, depicting scenes from the period of the Battle of Oliwa, are a fragment of the collection of the *Apotheosis of Maritime Poland* series, which was restored after the war and destroyed by the occupiers in 1939. The collection of models of famous sailing ships recorded in the maritime history of the world includes: Christopher Columbus\'s *Santa Maria*, the flagship British liner *Victory* from the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the British ship of the line *Sovereign of the Seas* from the 17th century or a model of a classic clipper ship.\n\nEnriching the exhibition of ancient sailing ships are original pieces of armament and ordnance of those who fought on board the ships.

Among the ship\'s artillery relics are true rarities, such as a double 40 mm Bofors anti-aircraft cannon from the submarine *Sęp* (an identical copy was on the sister vessel *Orzeł*), the most famous anti-aircraft cannon of World War II - a 20 mm Oerlikon from the equipment of ORP *Blyskawica* or a double 13.2 mm Hotchkiss HMG excavated from the wreck of *Gryf*, bombed on Hel in September 1939. A poignant complement to that drama is a shred of a flag with a fragment of an eagle, salvaged from the sunken ORP *Gryf*, brass letters comprising the ship\'s name dismantled from the wreck, and the original lifebelt.\n\nUnderwater weapons are represented by torpedoes of several types - from the unique German design from the turn of the 19th/20th century. One of the most valuable exhibits is the French SM 5 naval mine, used by Polish submarines during the September campaign. The Kriegsmarine minesweeper \"M 85\" sank on an identical one in October 1939. Among the weapons used for anti-submarine warfare, the British-made Thornycroft depth bomb thrower draws attention. The destroyer ORP *Blyskawica* was armed with throwers of this type. The second copy is still on board the ship.\n\nA unique exhibit, of world rank, is the German bombotorpedo of the BT (Bomben-Torpedo) 1000 RS series. The idea to develop this offensive aerial weapon originated from an attempt to combine the advantages of bombs and aerial torpedoes. The only known version of these supported by a rocket engine was the BT 1000 RS. Anti-aircraft guns, depth bomb throwers, Type 08/39 and JAM mines came from ships operated in the post-war years. Naval aviation armament from this period is represented by cannons, guided and unguided missiles. The largest weapon on display is the P 21 anti-ship missile from the armament of *Tarantul*-class corvettes. These were the primary strike ships of the Polish fleet for many years.

Since 1968 the place has held the status of the Monument of National Remembrance (since 2002 – the Site of National Remembrance in Łambinowice).\n\nThe exhibition comprises seven parts which show the history of the Site of National Remembrance in Łambinowice and its contemporary state as well as the activity of the Central Museum of Prisoners-of-War. The successive sections are devoted to the most important objects in this place, including as follows: the Old POW Cemetery, the area of the former Stalag 318/VIII F (344) Lamsdorf, the area of the former Stalag VIII B (344) Lamsdorf, the Cemetery of the Soviet POWs, the  Cemetery of the Victims of the Labor Camp and the building of the Museum in Łambinowice.\n\nThe exhibition has an interesting form, with the narration beginning in contemporary times and then taking the visitor on a tour to get to know the history of the individual objects and the vicissitudes of people related to them. It is their presence – that of the multitude of several hundred thousand people coming from nearly all the continents – which has left a clear imprint on this extensive area. This comes to be realized in view of the available documents, photographs, written and oral accounts, memoirs and original memorabilia. Over the years the location and the range of the camps in Lamsdorf were undergoing changes. In order to help the visitor follow the changes in the deployment of the camps at different stages, relevant models were prepared. They are complemented by a series of backlit photographs.

Aleksander Sochaczewski (proper name Lejb Sonder) was born on May 3, 1843 in the settlement of Iłów near Sochaczew to a Jewish family. Artistically talented, he studied painting at the Warsaw School of Fine Arts from 1858. Already during his studies he exhibited his works as one of the most talented students. At the beginning of the 1860s, during the revival of Polish independence activity, he, like many other students, joined the left wing of the underground - the Red camp. He took part in patriotic demonstrations and was also involved in the distribution of illegal publications. He was arrested in dramatic circumstances on September 1, 1862 and imprisoned in the 10th Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel. During a search of his apartment, among other things, weapons, molds for casting bullets, daggers used to execute traitors, many conspiratorial prints, secret press, etc. were found. As a result, on April 24, 1863, he was sentenced to death, later commuted by the governor of the Kingdom of Poland, Grand Duke Konstantin, to 20 years\' imprisonment and sent in stages to Siberia that year. He served his sentence in the salt works at Usol near Irkutsk. After several years, under an amnesty, he had the rest of his sentence commuted to exile. He lived in Irkutsk for a while, then in Perm. After returning from Siberia in 1883, he emigrated to Munich, where many Polish painters lived and worked. He later settled in Brussels, and in 1901 settled permanently in Vienna. His twenty-year stay in Siberia left traces in his memory and psyche for the rest of his life. As a result, he created many works in exile, including on the basis of sketches he brought back from Siberia, in which he referred to his dramatic experiences in the East. His paintings depict the realities of the lives of Siberian exiles and convicts; they include many genre scenes illustrating the conditions of travel to Siberia, working conditions, daily life, escape scenes, etc. The artist also portrayed a number of authentic figures, mainly his fellow sufferers. Already during his stay in exile, the painter exhibited his works many times, including in Munich, London, Brussels, Budapest, Krakow and Rzeszow. In 1913, his paintings adorned the famous exhibition in Lviv, organized on the 50th anniversary of the January Uprising. Plagued by privation, a few years before his death (he died on June 15, 1923 in Austria) he donated his collection to the city of Lviv in exchange for a life annuity. Thanks to this, the one-of-a-kind \"Siberian collection\" did not disperse. It became the property of the Lviv National Museum. Later it shared the dramatic fate of Lviv, which was under Soviet occupation from September 1939, and then, from 1941, under Nazi occupation. During the latter, she was kept in Kiev. It returned to Poland in 1956, as part of the many polonica from the former Polish eastern borderlands transferred by the USSR authorities at the time. It then became the property of the Historical Museum of the City of Warsaw, and after the creation of the Museum of the 10th Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel in 1963, it ended up here as a permanent deposit. Currently 118 paintings and sketches for individual works by the artist are exhibited here.','https://goout.net/i/097/978987-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14702,5),(32352,'Kresy i Bezkresy w zbiorach Muzeum Niepodległości','Since its inception, the Museum has sought to open its doors as widely as possible to the borderland communities through its popularization and research activities, which are expressed in the organization of exhibitions, conferences, publications and artistic events devoted to the broadly defined topic of the borderlands. The Museum\'s collections contain many exhibits devoted to this subject, as can be seen from the three groups distinguished in the exhibition: *Krzemieniecka Collection*, *Leopolis Collection* and *Sybiracka Collection,* which form the core of the exhibition. The Vilnius – *Vilniana Collection* has also been included in the exhibition.\n\nThe exhibition *Bezkresy* mainly consists of realia included in the *Sibiotic Collection* and paintings in the Museum\'s collection. *Memory cannot be exterminated – this is the title of the part of the exhibition, which requires constant reminding, devoted to the crime of genocide committed against Polish prisoners of war incarcerated in NKVD special camps. The inclusion of this element in the part of the exhibition called “boundless” has a twofold significance. The first is axiological – showing the infinitude of the degenerate crime, and the second indicating the direct relationship of the families to the murdered, who were exiled to the Asian interregnums. In many cases, the fact of the crime against the prisoners of war became at the same time a sentence of exile for their families. The second part – *The Cleansing of the Backstage* – aims to present the deportation of the Polish population. An animation show accompanies the images. The third part – *Living against the odds* – depicts the difficult adaptation of the deportees and the daily life filled with longing.

The richly decorated hallway of the town hall contains a staircase and gallery, which were reconstructed after being destroyed during World War II.\n\nThe most representative room in the town hall was the White Hall, where courts were held and international agreements and contracts were signed. The hall was used for royal audiences and the king\'s representative, as well as for citizenship ceremonies. Among the preserved elements of the White Hall are portraits of Polish kings and a marble fireplace.\n\nThe Red Hall, less representative than the White Hall, was the venue of the city council meetings.

Over the course of several years (until 1787) it was extensively modernised and adapted to the needs of the new wealthy owner. The house, inhabited by Uphagen until his death in 1802, then passed to subsequent heirs, remaining - a rarity at the time - in the hands of a single family throughout the 19th century. In 1911, a museum was established in Uphagen\'s tenement, which operated until 1944. At that time, German conservators evacuated its decor and furnishings. The house, like the city, was destroyed in March 1945. The tradition of the museum was revived in 1998 with the opening of the Museum of Burgher Interiors in June.\n\nToday, in the Johann Uphagen House, one can see the residential and business premises. There is a vestibule, a small merchant\'s cantor (now adapted as a museum shop), a lounge located on the mezzanine floor, lined with wooden panelling with painted scenes of Chinese themes, fashionable in the 18th century. On the first floor facing the street is the drawing room, the most representative interior of the house. The room is decorated with white panelling with panels depicting ancient buildings. The walls above the panelling are covered with fabrics. The ceiling is decorated with elaborate stucco decoration, which was once gilded and painted in colours.

Through their work, carpenters significantly influenced the development of regional building varieties and the beauty of architecture. It was carpenters who, almost until the middle of the 20th century, determined the unique appearance of villages and towns.

One can learn about the history of the settlement of these lands in the Middle Ages, Pomeranian legends, peasant quadrilateral homesteads, Pomeranian harvest festivals, everyday life, fishing traditions, or the birth of Nazism, up to the resettlement of the population after the end of the Second World War. The exhibition features interesting maps by Rudolf Hardow showing the pre-war region of Central Pomerania. With the help of drawings, the maps depict the history of settlement and material and immaterial culture in Central Pomerania. This multi-faceted exhibition is augmented by multimedia.\n\nThe barn also presents a section of an exhibition on weaving in Pomerania. Almost every farm sowed a plot of flax, hemp and raised sheep, from which raw materials for clothing and other textiles were obtained year after year. The journey through this extremely interesting field begins with a presentation of flax and the tools used to process it: thorns, shakers, whisks and brushes. Further on in the exhibition are spinning tools: spindles, spinning wheels, reels and devices for measuring thread and winding: bobbins, whisks, hoes, snowplows. An important part of the exhibition is the weaving workshop, where linen canvases are woven. Also on display are various techniques for decorating textiles: lace, selvedges, embroidery and prints. A common method of decoration in Pomerania was printing. This was done using special wooden blocks, with which the design was imprinted. Printed fabrics were used for clothing, bedding and table linen. The original wooden blocks can be seen in the exhibition. Also on display are old clothes and tailoring, as a common household occupation and a profession taught in Pomeranian schools.\n\nThe exhibition closes with an outbuilding, which displays agricultural tools and is also home to sheep; and a bread oven, where breads and cakes are still baked according to archival recipes, as well as an ice house.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179445-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14798,6),(32357,'Swołowo 14','#### One of the homesteads that make up the Museum of Pomeranian Folk Culture in Swołów.\n\\\nTwo hundred years ago there were no buildings in this place. A plot of land belonging to the reeve was set aside for a homestead and a small area of land. In the second half of the 19th century a homestead stood here, whose owner, Miss Joanne Paulina Luisa Albrecht, was counted as a cottager. This was the most disadvantaged group of landowners. At that time her homestead included about 2 hectares. At the beginning of the 20th century the homestead grew to five buildings, and the farmer already belonged to the middle class of farmers, i.e. the homesteaders.\n\nThe centrepiece of the exhibition is the farmer\'s house, built in a timber-frame construction, on a rectangular and nearly symmetrical plan. In the clay filling of the attic walls, there\'s a finger engraving that says *1864*, which may be the year of construction. The central position is occupied by a wide chimney of domed form made of unfired brick. A tiled cooker is also located here. In the first room are the basic household appliances. Temporary exhibitions are periodically held in the other rooms of the house. There is also a bread house adjacent to the house, built in the early 20th century. Inside is a large dome-shaped bread oven clad in clay on the outside. It was used to bake bread and roast meats.\n\nThe homestead also includes a blacksmith\'s shop—an indispensable building in every old village. It is the only building in the museum which does not come from Swołowo; the smithy was moved from the nearby village of Pęplino. Inside there is a blacksmith\'s hearth, the boiler with a chimney, as well as machines and tools used by the blacksmith. The furnishings of the smithy include items and equipment necessary for the work. Every year in August, a blacksmith\'s open-air event is organised here together with the Blacksmith Forum Association. The open-air event attracts blacksmithing enthusiasts, who for several days observe the work of blacksmiths from all over Poland and participate in demonstrations and blacksmithing attractions.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179437-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14798,5),(32358,'Effatha, to znaczy: Otwórz się! Ludowe rytuały lecznicze na Pomorzu','#### The permanent exhibition *Effatha, or Open Up! Folk Healing Rituals in Pomerania* in the Museum of Pomeranian Folk Culture tells the story of how the former inhabitants of Pomerania imagined illnesses, how they fell ill, what healing and curing techniques they used. It takes up the topics of folk diseases, folk medicine, as well as life, death and the Absolute.\n\\\nThe exhibition scenario is based on written sources, mainly literary and ethnographic, from the 19th and early 20th centuries. The exhibition is not a precise reconstruction of folk healing, nor is it an exhaustive presentation of all the remedies and local healing techniques formerly used by Pomeranians. It is in fact a proposal to read the meaning of various forms of healing and religious-magical practices, emphasising their symbolic aspect. The search for an understanding of the phenomenon of folk healing takes place in the perspective of myth and ritual. The exhibition leads sequentially through four areas (corresponding to the following rooms): 1. folk diseases; 2. healing; 3. healers; 4. healing magic. The exhibition presents exhibits from the collection of the Middle Pomerania Museum in Słupsk. On the way through the exhibition, the exhibits, their accompanying descriptions as well as the illustrations speak with equal intensity. A special place in the exhibition space is occupied by short animated films devoted to folklore ills (*koltun, róża, zaraza, urok, ochwat*), prepared in cooperation with artists from the Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow.\n\nIn folk healing, elements of a magical, religious and psychological nature played an important role. It was commonly believed that illnesses were the result of sin, contamination, contact with demons, impurity, breaking taboos, rules of social life, sacred time, etc. All illnesses aroused fear. In order to counteract this, attempts were made to personify illness - in the rural imagination, illness acquired the status not of a thing, but of a person with certain human characteristics: it could be capricious, unmerciful, hostile to humans, malicious, cunning, merciless, implacable, insidious. Disease was treated as an entity in its own right, a hostile being from outside, visible or not, possessing a powerful force that destroyed man from within. Folk medicine is rife with magical and mysterious activities, seemingly devoid of meaning. Folk medicine accommodates bizarre ways of healing, ordering diseases, magical methods of producing medicines. Folk medicine is based on the power drawn from the sacred—it is a syncretic mixture of pagan beliefs, especially those related to nature worship with elements of Christian rituals, as well as distorted scientific knowledge. Until the end of the nineteenth century, and even into the twentieth century, the healthcare needs of the countryside could be met almost exclusively through forms of folk healing. Healing rituals were carried out by people especially predestined for this purpose, called \"wise men\" or sorcerers/witch doctors, who were regarded as initiates, \"God\'s chosen ones\", predestined to practise healing—they healed \"in God\'s name\". The aim of the healing rituals was to bring the sick person out of illness and, in the symbolic sphere, to bring them out of a state of apparent death and restore the individual to the community. Both the words (incantations, formulas for relief) and the props used (everyday objects that acquired special power during the ritual), as well as herbs and other remedies of mineral or animal origin, played an important role in them. The Pomeranians generally treated medicines of plant origin as slow-acting remedies, but their properties could be freely modified with the appropriate spells and orders. Plants from further afield were considered better than those from the immediate area. This was because it was believed that the farther away from home, the village—i.e. the centres—and the closer to the afterlife, the more powerful and healing power flourished in them.\n\nAmong the most interesting exhibits on show are the order cards. It is known from ethnographic accounts that witches and wizards in Pomerania formerly used handwritten spell books (German: *Zauberbuch*), also known as whispering books (*Flüsterbok*). The secret books contained sorcerer\'s knowledge, formulas for orders and curses and recipes for herbal specifics. They also served as textbooks for students of the sorcerer\'s trade. With the spread of writing among the villagers, knowledge was sometimes written down. German folklore scholars report that manuscript books for medicinal use were still in circulation in Pomerania in the early 20th century. None of these have survived to the present day. Probably the only remnants of these secret books are the two cards with manuscript orders from Żychlin from the 17th century presented at the exhibition. A special place in the exhibition has been given to a magic wand dating from the 19th century, which was used in magic in the Sławno district. The wand takes the form of a spontaneous pine branch with cones and is a natural curiosity (hence its use in magic). The magic wand (*Zauberstaub, Wunschenruthe*) was used in magic rituals to symbolically demarcate boundaries by drawing a magic circle in a circular motion, to direct energy and finally to evoke supernatural phenomena. When used by a sorcerer/witch, it can be a source of good or evil. The wand must be guarded as it is charged with power—a powerful strange force.\n\n**exhibition design:** Mikołaj Radomski\\\n**translations:** Robert Kupisiński (Lingua Lab, Kraków)\\\n**exhibition construction:** Grzegorz Jarzembiński, Krzysztof Kilanowski, Roman Płatek\\\n**illustrations:** Ewa Grzesiak, Alicja Kot, Edyta Mąsior, Wojciech Sobczyk, Robert Sowa\\\n**film directors:** Julia Piwowarczyk, Oliwia Barczyk, Katarzyna Grząka, Julia Furdyna, Karolina Walas\\\n**film etnographic consultant:** Mikołaj Radomski\\\n**film artistic consultant: Wojciech Sobczyk\\\n**film consultant:** Ewa Grzesiak\\\n**film executive producers:** Żaneta Kominiak, Anna Waszczuk\\\n**film producers:** Aneta Zagórska, Robert Sowa\\\n**film production:** Kraków Film Klaster – Krakow Animation Centre, Jan Matejko Academy of Fine Arts in Krakow','https://goout.net/i/117/1179364-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14798,5),(32359,'Zagroda nr 8','#### One of the homesteads that make up the Swołowo Museum of the Folk Culture of Pomerania.\n\\\nSuch homesteads were erected in Pomerania in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and their owners were wealthy middle-class peasants. The entrance to the enclosed courtyard is through a gate building. In the back there is a house, and the whole is enclosed on the sides by a barn and a livestock building. More or less in the middle of the courtyard of this type of farmhouse a manure pit is located. Behind the house stood the farm buildings and sheds for tools and agricultural equipment. There was also a vegetable and flower garden and an orchard.\n\nFrom 1659 the farmstead remained in the hands of the Albrecht family, who arrived in Swołowo from the depths of Germany probably as early as the 15th or 17th century. The last farmers of that year were Gerard and Herda Albrecht. It was they who, on 10 May 1934, received an oak plaque of honour during a ceremony in Starków (honouring 131/121 families, including 9 from Swołów, who had settled in Pomerania for over 200 years). Everything changed after 1945. As a result of the Second World War, which was instigated by the Nazi Third Reich, there were mass population displacements throughout Europe. The defeat of Germany led to the conceding of this part of Pomerania to Poland and, from 1945, to the displacement of German inhabitants beyond the River Oder. They were replaced by settlers from various parts of Poland, including Masovia, Kielce, Lublin, as well as expatriates from the areas constituting the so-called Eastern Borderlands of the Second Republic, which Poland lost to the USSR after the war. The German inhabitants of Swołów, among them Gerard Albrecht with his wife Herda and daughter Minna, left the village and went to West Germany. The first Polish farmer in homestead no. 8 8 was Tadeusz Piecuski. As a former prisoner of the Stutthof concentration camp, he was given the opportunity by the authorities to settle one of the farms. The Piecuski family lived in the homestead until 1952. They could not withstand the harassment meted out to them by the communist authorities. At that time, they were treated like rich people, the so-called kulaks, and these were ruthlessly destroyed by the authorities. After them, the farm was taken over by Jan Kowalski and his family; they lived here until the end of the last century. The Middle Pomerania Museum took over the homestead in 2002.\n\nThe first of the buildings of the homestead is a barn from 1858 with a cellar. Inside it, in the outermost room, there are silage silos, an original wooden barrel for manure and old agricultural machinery (ploughs, cultivators, harrows). Other rooms are set up with machinery for processing crops: choppers, threshing machines, a grinder, a windrower. The barn is also used to store hay and food for the animals and grain. The cellar was used to store potatoes, swedes and beetroot, among other things. Adjacent to the barn are a well and a chicken coop where chickens of various breeds, including green-legged hens, are kept.\n\nThe most important element of the homestead is, of course, the more than 150-year-old dwelling house, characteristic of a rich Pomeranian farmer. The interiors have been recreated with great care on the basis of accounts from both the former German inhabitants of Swołów and the first Polish settlers. The exhibits do not come from the house itself, but are from the area of Swołów and its immediate surroundings. In the house one can see the reeve\'s office, the parade room - living room, bedroom, cellar next to the bedroom, kitchen, larder, hallway, Altenteil - the part for the old ones - the area separated by a hallway from the one inhabited by the young farmers, usually belonging to their parents who handed down the property to them: kitchen, bedroom and parade room - living room.\n\nThe barn combines its original function with museum activities. Horses, sheep, goats and geese and ducks are reared in the lower part of the building. In the gallery, in turn, two exhibitions are presented. The first is *Brewing in Swołów*, which is an exhibition about beer, which was a popular drink in Central Pomerania in former centuries and consumed on many occasions. The second exhibition is *Pomeranian Cuisine*, which is about the equipment of the former Pomeranian kitchen: household appliances needed to prepare food and preserves. A curiosity here are the antique wooden moulds for gingerbread and butter.\n\nThe building originally intended for seasonal workers of the Albrecht family now houses a restaurant serving traditional Pomeranian goose dishes, the Swołowo Inn, which is open daily in high season. A garden is also open to visitors, with old fruit trees: cherries, apple and pear trees, as well as vegetables and flowers. For the youngest visitors there is a playground with wooden swings, rockers and toys. In spring and summer, outdoor events, family picnics and music festivals are held here. For organised groups, the garden is made available for meetings, team-building events, and bonfires are organised for children and school groups. The museum also owns 1 hectare of agricultural land adjacent to this farmstead - horses and sheep graze here.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179413-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14798,5),(32360,'Swołowo.

It is presented in a historic barn, renovated according to period carpentry principles, preserving as much of the historic substance as possible.\n\\\nThe stories told by former and current residents range from the interwar period to the beginning of the 21st century. The themes touched upon in the exhibition include the history of the inhabitants of homestead no. 26 in Swołowo in the context of the Second World War—this story was heard by the authors of the exhibition from Mrs Alena Mrazowa, daughter of Charlotte Klein, who in August 1939, at the age of 14, was sent by the Labour Office in Słupsk to the village of Schwolow (Swołowo) together with her friend Maria Střílkova. The history of Swołowo in 1939–1945 is also discussed—the war and its impact on the village, forced labourers on peasant farms and the townspeople\'s attitude towards Nazism.\n\nThe second part of Swołów\'s history was written by the inhabitants who arrived here after 1945. The exhibition touches upon themes of resettlement, travel stories, memories of settling Swołowo by Polish inhabitants (including the history of the Borderlands Poles), and an extremely interesting theme of the first post-war years in the aspect of village management, including forced collectivisation, destruction of private initiative, propaganda of the communist authorities of the time; political changes in the 1990s and their influence on the life of Swołowo inhabitants.\n\nThe exhibition also touches on the subject of water and wind mills in the Słupsk district. Among all the mills (over 200!) shown in photographs and maps, there are two Swołowo windmills that do not exist today and the history of their successive owners. An important element of Swołowo\'s history was the introduction of a branded product of rural tourism in Poland—the so-called \'Checkered Land\' and the recognition of the village as its \'Capital\'. The next point in the history of Swołowo was the creation of the Museum of Pomeranian Folk Culture, in the hope of preserving the historic character of the village.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179337-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14798,6),(32361,'Witkacy Differently','*Witkacy Differently* is a temporary exhibition presenting the second part of the collection of Witkacy\'s works—more than 100 works, mainly pastel portraits, complemented by publications.

The City and the People','#### \"Słupsk. The City and the People\" is an exhibition created with the residents of the city in mind, settlers who—for various reasons—came to Slupsk after World War II to start a new life here in Pomerania.\n\\\nThey occupied the houses of the previous German inhabitants and, bringing with them elements of the culture of their homelands, gave rise to the multicoloured cultural mosaic of contemporary Slupsk and the region. In the post-war, partly destroyed Słupsk, they had to organise administration, self-government, cultural, scientific and economic life from the beginning. Although they often lacked experience and competence, thanks to their commitment and perseverance they created and accomplished extraordinary things.\n\nThe exhibition is a story about the people and the city to which they came. When we talk about a city, we often forget what makes it, namely the human aspect. And yet every city is associated with fates that are common to whole groups and specific to individual people, sometimes tragic, and certainly worth commemorating. The story of the city was created through the juxtaposition of old and contemporary photographs, which show what changes have taken place in the city since 1945. The story of the people, which is based on post-war memories recorded in the form of interviews, shows how the settlers turned an alien world into their new home. The exhibition aims to show their story as an important part of the history of our city and as a consequence of the Second World War.\n\nMany of the exhibits are gifts from Słupsk residents: personal mementos and documents. Material testimonies of those times, connected with buildings, places, workplaces and cultural institutions, such as settlement announcements, posters, placards, banners, as well as objects of daily use, magazines, books or furniture, are also an integral part of the exhibition. The exhibition also includes a display case with artefacts that the museum receives on an ongoing basis as donations from local residents. These are replaced every few months. Presenting one\'s own fate through personal memorabilia enables donors and visitors to identify more fully with the exhibition.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179128-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14799,5),(32363,'In Reference to Witkacy From the 19th to the 21st Century','*In Reference to Witkacy From the 19th to the 21st Century* is a permanent exhibition occupying two and a half floors of the White Granary, one of the buildings of the Middle Pomerania Museum in Słupsk. The concept of the exhibition is to select eighteen motifs from the oeuvre and biography of Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz Witkacy (landscape, still life, portrait, self-portrait, figural composition, genre scene, nude, animalistic, aquatic landscape, sculpture, artistic textiles, graphics, regional artists, technology and military) and compare them with identical themes composed or designed by artists and creators from the 19th century to the present day.\n\nThe exhibition includes around 200 paintings, prints, posters, drawings, artistic textiles, sculptures, military uniforms and technical objects. It features works by four groups of artists, i.e. the Classics - Witkacy\'s predecessors, his contemporaries, the Formists and those born after the artist\'s death.

At the same time, it is the only monographic exhibition of Witkacy in Poland.\n\\\nThe exhibition reflects the structure of the Słupsk collection. Works from all periods of the artist\'s work are shown, especially pastel portraits created within the framework of the one-person Portrait Company \"S. I. Witkiewicz\" operating in the years 1925–1939. Archives and books are confronted with artistic works, and do not form a separate part of the exhibition. The exhibition includes more than 135 paintings, drawings and graphic works, as well as manuscripts, typescripts, correspondence and books (including those with dedications by Witkacy). The arrangement of the exhibition emphasises the artistic qualities of the works without being competitive or visually distracting.\n\nThe exhibition is divided into two parts. Part one shows the evolution of Witkacy\'s work, its sections being: Zakopane, First Journeys and Experiences, In Russia, Among the Formists, In the World of Pure Form, The Year 1924, The Portrait Company \"S. I. Witkiewicz\". The second part presents the former private collections of Witkacy\'s works, from which most of the works collected in the Slupsk museum come. These are the collections of: Włodzimierz Nawrocki, Jan and Janina Leszczyński, Modesta Zwolińska, the Głogowski family and Teodor Białynicki-Birula.\n\nA separate place is devoted to the presentation of conservation issues, where one can see, for example, a pane of glass with pastel flecks and a portrait that used to be behind it. The exhibition is accompanied by films about, among other things, the history of the Słupsk collection, and a special newspaper entitled *Witkacy*, published in Polish and English, in which the various parts of the exhibition are discussed. At the multimedia stations, visitors can search for portraits according to criteria of their choice, e.g. year of creation or type of drugs used, and trace how the colour of the paper on which Witkacy drew has changed over the years. The glass walls of the storeroom of Witkacy\'s works of art make it possible to peep into those parts of the museum which are usually hidden from the visitor\'s eye.','https://goout.net/i/117/1178949-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14799,6),(32365,'The Cultural Reality of Pomerania in the Past and Today','#### In the Slupsk Castle Mill, a part of the rich ethnographic collection of the Central Pomerania Museum is presented on a permanent exhibition occupying the lower and middle floors.\n\\\nPart of it represents the culture of the region\'s former indigenous population—including the Kashubians, the Slavs, the Krajniaks of Złotowo, the inhabitants of Jamno and Łabusz. The second part consists of souvenirs of settlers who came to Pomerania after 1945 from Kurpie, Opoczno, Łowicz, Rawa Mazowiecka, as well as the Vilnius, Grodno, Polesie and Southern Borderlands—from near Lviv and Stanisławów. The ground-level exhibition presents the culture of the people who lived in Pomerania up to 1945: furniture from country cottages, religious paintings, household utensils, documents and old photographs.

In total, there are more than 1,400 exhibits. They are presented in chronological and typological order. These include basic cutlery—spoons, knives and forks, as well as specialised cutlery for serving and eating one type of dish, such as oysters or berries. Separately, serial products are presented, mainly from the Polish manufacturers Norblin and Fraget.\n\nThe core of the exhibition is cutlery made between 1875 and 1939 in European factories—mostly German and Polish as well as English and French; there are also American products. Some of the pieces are artisanal products made in small goldsmith\'s workshops—others were made in manufactures and even in large factories.\n\nA significant part of the exhibition consists of two finds discovered after the war in Słupsk. Both were hidden in 1945 by residents evacuating from the city. The first is the legacy of the noble von Kleist family—tableware comprising almost 300 items, mainly silver cutlery and marked with the owners\' coats of arms. The second is the possessions of a middle-class bourgeois family—glassware and faience. Other objects were collected over several decades; some come from the pre-war Heimatmuseum.\n\n**exhibition script:** Anna Sujecka\\\n**exhibition design:** Grzegorz Sujecki','https://goout.net/i/117/1179064-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14801,6),(32367,'Early Pomeranian Art from the 14th to the 18th Century','#### On the first floor of the Slupsk Castle, in four rooms, early Pomeranian art from the 14th to the 18th century is presented. The vast majority of the exhibits come from the area of present-day Central Pomerania, i.e. from the vicinity of Słupsk, Darłowo, Koszalin and Kołobrzeg. The exhibition is complemented by individual objects created throughout Europe (and beyond) and 19th-century relics.\n\\\nOn display are monuments of medieval art, largely wood carvings. With more than sixty objects, the collection of Pomeranian Gothic sculpture is presented almost in its entirety. It is worth mentioning that this is one of the largest collections of its kind in Poland. Among the exhibits, fragments of a multi-part altarpiece (or polyptych) from the post-Cistercian church in Bukowo Morskie—the only painting work from the Middle Ages in the museum\'s collection—stand out. The so-called Renaissance Room presents, among other things, furniture, tapestries, plates, paintings and pieces of weaponry created mainly in the 16th and 17th centuries. These artefacts allow visitors to imagine what type of objects might have been used by the inhabitants of the Słupsk castle and decorated its interiors during the heyday of this residence of the Griffins. On the walls are two sizable 17th-century Flemish tapestries depicting mythological scenes. The next room is devoted to modern art from the Pomeranian region. The exhibits presented in its first part come mainly from Pomeranian churches. In the 1630s, Pomeranian dukes adopted a Protestant religion, which influenced the decoration and furnishings of their churches. The Słupsk museum has a rich collection of epitaphs and posthumous mementos. These were works of art commemorating the deceased nobles and benefactors of the community (e.g. burghers and craftsmen), buried in the churches\' vaults.\n\nIn this part of the hall, a part of the numismatic collection can also be seen in two polychrome iron chests. In the smaller chest, the so-called treasury, Pomeranian coins are presented. In the larger chest, once regarded as the town treasury of Słupsk, fragments of two treasures are on display: from Garsk and from Włynków. Of particular note is the denarius of Bolesław Chrobry minted after 992. It is probably the oldest Polish coin (only two copies have been preserved in Poland). On its obverse there is a back inscription with the name of the ruler and an arrow against the background of a bush composed of 6 branches, described as the \"Tree of Life\". On the reverse is an isosceles cross with arms crossed and ending in circles. Also on display are examples of religious painting and a large portrait of Pastor Michael Mostnik. This part of the exhibition is complemented by gold and tin wares, presented in showcases. There are liturgical items from Pomeranian churches: candlesticks, chalices and a monstrance. A tin baptismal bowl from the parish in Zagórzyca deserves special attention. Also attracting attention is a silver cup from Augsburg—one of the elements of the so-called von Kleist treasure. In one of the bays Danzig furniture and models of sailing ships are presented, reminding of Słupsk\'s contacts with the sea and port cities.\n\nThe last part of the exhibition is devoted to Pomeranian palaces. Unfortunately, wartime losses and subsequent neglect make it impossible to fully admire the legacy of the noble families of the area. Most of the artefacts were lost or destroyed at a time when the palaces were used as the headquarters of State Farms and schools. Among the preserved objects, the furniture and porcelain wares are particularly beautiful. The walls are decorated with portraits of members of the Specht and Riemer families, which hung in a manor house in Objazd before the war. Today, they are among the few landowner portraits kept in the Museum\'s collection.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179059-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14801,6),(32368,'From the Past of Słupsk','#### The first permanent exhibition in the Museum of Central Pomerania in Słupsk dedicated to the history of the city.\n\\\nMost of the objects on display were created between the 17th and 20th centuries, but there are also earlier ones from archaeological excavations. In the first room, attention is drawn to the former furnishings of Slupsk churches, only a few of which have been preserved to this day. Graphic postcards and watercolours give an insight into the former appearance of the churches, most of which are still important landmarks in the city\'s skyline. Another group is formed by the products of the Słupsk guilds, including magnificent tin cups and jugs, more modest cups and candlesticks. The second room exhibits city plans and views, government insignia, old documents and objects related to everyday life and the functioning of the city, such as a fuse, a cup or a hook for a tram cable. You can also see photographs of post-war Słupsk and medals of cultural events from the last few decades.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179041-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14801,6),(32369,'Treasures of the Pomeranian Dukes','#### The permanent exhibition *Treasures of the Pomeranian Dukes* at the Słupsk Castle presents memorabilia of the last inhabitants of the castle, who were the last of the Griffin dynasty in Pomerania.\n\\\nThe main place of the exhibition is occupied by two tin, richly decorated sarcophagi: of Duchess Anna de Croy and her son Ernest Bogusław de Croy. After the funeral ceremonies, they were deposited in the crypt of the castle church (today\'s St. Jack\'s Church) and remained there intact until 1977, when they were opened by a commission. The tin sarcophagi and the objects excavated from them were subjected to conservation, and when this was completed, the dukes\' keepsakes were put on display in the castle. The remains of the last Griffins are buried in the crypt in front of the altar in the church, in contemporary sarcophagi. Five flags are displayed above the sarcophagi. These are extremely valuable objects, not only because of the intricate workmanship and very good state of preservation, but above all because of their uniqueness—very few flags made for funeral ceremonies have survived.\n\nIn the showcases are the cushion and gown of Italian silk velvet excavated from the coffin of Princess Anna, and from the sarcophagus of Duke Ernest Bogusław a cloak of silk velvet and satin embroidered with silk and metal threads, a bottom robe and cushion of brocade, stockings and knee-length trousers made of fine silk fabric. These robes were specially prepared for the burial. They were made from high-quality fabrics imported from Italy and France. In a separate display case, one can see two gold bracelets with sandalwood fillings (so-called balsams), a gold enamelled cross on a ribbon, a silver plate, an enamelled gold ring, a ring with a single diamond and a gold ring with fifteen diamonds and a date commemorating the death of Princess Anne. The rings and the wedding ring were found in the sarcophagus of Ernest Boguslaw, who was buried with the jewellery left to him by his mother.\n\nIn the same display case, there are also five medals that the prince commissioned from distinguished medallists for various celebrations. Of particular note is a medal made in 1668 depicting a bust of the duke on the obverse and, on the reverse, a \'wild man\' leaning against the altar and holding a shield with the Croy family coat of arms. The centrepiece of the exhibition features a 17th-century portrait of Duchess Anna from an altarpiece from the church in Smołdzino. This painting was discovered during conservation work and donated to the museum. The exhibition is complemented by a pair of tin candlesticks and a silver chalice with a paten funded by Duchess Anna for the church in Smołdzino, and a pair of silver candlesticks funded by Prince Ernest Bogusław.\n\nOpposite the entrance to the hall is a unique example of Pomeranian art—the Darłowo silver altar. The altar, originally funded by Prince Philip II, the greatest patron of the arts from the House of Griffins, took thirty years to create (1606-1636). Philip II commissioned 27 silver plates with biblical representations. The retable, or altarpiece, was made of ebony wood only in 1636, commissioned by Duchess Elisabeth, widow of Duke Boguslaw XIV. Only eight of the 27 tiles have survived to the present day, and most of the silver decorations adorning the retable have also not survived. In the window niche to the right of the altar is the sarcophagus of the Saxon-Laudenburg princess Catherine Ursula, who spent most of her life in Slupsk, at the side of her aunt, Princess Erdmuty.','https://goout.net/i/117/1179039-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14801,5),(32370,'Permanent exhibition of the Sopot Museum','The Museum of Sopot acquired archival photographic documentation of the villa\'s interiors from the Claaszen family heiress in 2001-2002.

A project was prepared to restore the original wallpaper and decorative embellishments in the windows. Furnishings typical of Gdansk culture include Baroque Gdansk furniture, eclectic furniture from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, English prints from around 1800, Baroque Gdansk engravings and Dutch faience from Delft. Several pieces of furniture from the 18th-19th century, a copper water vat from the early 18th century, prints by G. Morland from the turn of the 18th-19th century and a late Baroque chandelier - all from the villa\'s original furnishings and decoration - were returned to Sopot in 2005 after the death of Ruth Koch (née Claaszen).

Some are very important, others less so; some are explicit, others hidden. At the beginnings of Gdynia, it is easy to grasp the most important threads: on the one hand, the dream of a modern, dynamic Poland, boldly looking to the future; on the other, romantic patriotism rooted in national history. The modernising effort of the young country, which wanted to make up for its civilisational backwardness, thus met with the need to serve the homeland. Without this meeting, there would have been no Gdynia, no great Baltic harbour built from scratch, and no city growing at an \"American\" pace, which soon became an object of universal pride.\n\nAll this was brutally interrupted by the German invasion in September 1939. The people of Gdynia were among the first victims of the cruel war—murdered, expelled, exploited as forced labourers. The end of the war did not bring the expected revival. Gdynia\'s citizens demanded their freedom in dramatic ways: in December 1970, the streets of the city were covered with the blood of workers protesting against the communist regime; in August 1980, Gdynia became one of Poland\'s most important centres of opposition to the injustice of the system.\n\nIn the shadow of the great historical and social processes, however, ordinary life went on. Gdynia\'s women and men graduated from Gdynia schools, got married in Gdynia churches, buried their dead in Gdynia cemeteries, took care of their Gdynia tenement houses, travelled to work in the Gdynia shipyard on Gdynia trolleybuses, did their shopping in a Gdynia hall, went to sea from Gdynia and returned to Gdynia.','https://goout.net/i/117/1178229-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14803,5),(32372,'Mundur żołnierza polskiego','An exhibition of 60 uniforms from the collection of the Wroclaw Museum of Militaria.

Initially, they were settlers from the Netherlands and Friesland - members of the Protestant Mennonite group, who could freely profess their faith in the tolerant Kingdom of Poland. They settled floodplains and wastelands from the Zulawy up the Vistula to Toruń and on to Mazovia. Over time, the term olender/olêder began to be used to refer to other settlers - Germans (Lutherans), as well as Poles (Catholics), who enjoyed privileges based on the legal system originally introduced for settlers from the Netherlands.\n\nThe main purpose of establishing the park is to recreate a fragment of the cultural landscape of the Vistula River village at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. On an area of more than 5 hectares, an Olêder village with the most characteristic layout, the so-called swamp row, was reconstructed. There are 3 complete homesteads consisting of 6 historic residential and farm buildings and a cemetery. They were moved from the Lower Vistula Valley area and date from the 18th and 19th centuries. These buildings are the most valuable surviving examples of architecture characteristic of the Olender settlers. They are surrounded by cultivated fields, meadows, gardens and orchards. The road connecting the individual homesteads has been planted with fruit trees, the drainage ditches with willows and the individual homesteads with high vegetation.','https://goout.net/i/116/1169755-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14806,5),(32375,'Salonik prof.

She led to the establishment of the Museum, was its director until her retirement in 1972. She maintained contact, cooperation with the Museum until the end of her life. She made a testamentary decision to donate to the museum \"scientific and all items needed to set up a permanent commemorative exhibition on the intersection of cultures,\" as she personally formulated it, and which from the beginning was understood to be a biographical exhibition dedicated to her. The professor\'s rich personality, numerous interests, contacts with well-known, interesting people are reflected in a legacy of more than 50 linear meters of files, still being organized and compiled. In June 2008, on the 110th anniversary of her birth, a permanent exhibition dedicated to the Museum\'s founder was opened.

The exhibition emphasizes the borderland nature of folk culture, which was heavily influenced by bourgeois and aristocratic culture, as well as political and civilization changes of the century 1850-1950. It tells about issues of identity, regional identification and attachment to a \"small homeland\". At the same time, it emphasizes the presence of various ethnic and religious groups in the area. The most valuable relics from the museum\'s collection are shown in such a way as to illustrate everyday life, many aspects of which are surprising, obscure, even exotic to the modern viewer. The presentation of folk culture over 100 years is superbly complemented by valuable archival materials (including very rich iconography). An asset is the modern form of the exhibition using audio recordings, film recordings and multimedia presentations. One can listen to recordings of wedding and funeral songs, as well as folk tales in a specially arranged space.

The presented set of works indicates the formal, content and stylistic assumptions of particular directions, tendencies and trends in Polish visual arts of the last sixty years. Its cognitive value is enhanced by the selection of works made with a view to presenting artists whose names have made a lasting mark on the history of art. At the same time, the exhibition familiarises viewers with selected works from the Bydgoszcz institution\'s collection that are the most representative of the exhibition\'s objectives. The show, which is a selection of works from the collection of several thousand items of Polish painting, graphics, sculpture, objects, installations and artistic photography of the 20th and 21st centuries, shows both the state of the possession and the concept of creating the Bydgoszcz gallery—an element of the Museum\'s global history.\n\nThe exhibition is designed for every audience: adults, young people and children, both those interested in visual arts and connoisseurs, as well as those who are just beginning their artistic education. The exhibition is the starting point for an educational programme introducing the world of Polish art of the last sixty years. Inspirations and Aspirations shows many aspects of creative expression in the context of both drawing inspiration from existing ideas (heirs) and attempts to develop their own artistic paths (pioneers, precursors). Alongside paintings, prints, sculpture or objects and projections, this issue is also addressed by objects from the field of art déco design, widely represented in the Museum\'s collection.

The exhibition is a kind of guide to Bydgoszcz, presenting the most important symbols of the city, elements of the city\'s architecture, interesting places, as well as people and their everyday life and the memorabilia they left behind. In addition, the role of interpreter of the realities of the inter-war world is played by Jerzy Sulima-Kamiński, author of the book *The Queen Jadwiga Bridge*. Quoted excerpts from his novel guide the viewer around successive places on the title walk, and the whole exhibition is intended to encourage confrontation of the knowledge gained at the exhibition with reality, trips around the city and individual discovery of its past.\n\nThe exhibition is divided thematically into two parts corresponding to the spatial arrangement of the rooms. In the first part, the viewer obtains general information on the history of Bydgoszcz, the structure of the city government, trade and crafts, the religious mosaic and symbols of the city. The second, proper part of the exhibition concentrates monuments related to the functioning of the interwar city and the life of Bydgoszcz citizens. Dominating this part of the exhibition are two tables, combining the features of a mock-up, a multimedia guide and a display of photographs, phallic objects and numismatic items. Surrounding the tables are diagonal showcases displaying objects of material culture, iconographic and cartographic sources, as well as documents, posters and advertisements, etc. The first part of the room shows the area around the Old Market Square, Mostowa Street and the river and Theatre Square. The most important square of the city, as the administrative and commercial centre of Bydgoszcz, is discussed here, and the role of the Brda river for trade and water transport, as well as water sports and recreation in the broadest sense of the term, is highlighted. Theatre Square, in turn, being a hub of public transport, also played the role of an area associated with Bydgoszcz\'s culture.\n\nThe second part of the room, on the other hand, focuses the viewer\'s attention on the development of Gdańska Street and Plac Wolności. Presented here are the contents of commerce and services, entertainment (hotels, cafes, restaurants) and celebrations of important events, integrally connected with the main artery of the city. Slightly further on, the economy in its broadest sense is depicted, including industry and urban investment. Alongside the issues mentioned above, the everyday life of the inhabitants of interwar Bydgoszcz is also presented. A strong aspect of this part of the exhibition is Polish-German relations, thanks to the documentation of the fate of the Bismarck Tower. The final stage of the walk is devoted to the City Museum, an institution dating back to the inter-war period. The exhibition is further enriched by retrospective \"windows of memory\"—multimedia whose task is to expand the historical content presented in the exhibition.','https://goout.net/i/116/1168048-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14807,6),(32379,'Twórczość Leona Wyczółkowskiego','#### Exhibition organised by the District Museum in Bydgoszcz dedicated to the works of its name patron, the Young Poland painter Leon Wyczółkowski.\n\\\nThe exhibition, based on own, artistic and biographical collections from the Leon Wyczółkowski Department, as well as from the collections of the Department of History and the Department of Numismatics, presents works by Wyczółkowski, trends in Polish painting and contextual cues about the artistic community of the turn of the 19th and 20th century.

These will include some particularly connected to Krakow, such as the Lajkonik costume, the Krakow nativity scene, or mascarons; those particularly related to local institutions, such as the silver rooster of the Fowler Brotherhood from the 16th century, the ring and scepter of Krakow mayors from the same century, the counter of the Krakow Merchant Congregation from the 18th century, but also works signed with the names of Jan Matejko, Józef Mehoffer, Zofia Stryjeńska, Jacek Malczewski, Wojciech Weiss and Wlastimil Hoffman. Those visiting Krzysztofory will also have an opportunity to enter a Krakow nativity scene, and more specifically its scaled version, co-created by nativity scene makers.','https://goout.net/i/115/1150805-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14813,5),(32387,'It Was Here That Poland Was Born','*Can historical events from over one thousand years back have any meaning for a modern Pole?* They surely can, because at that time Poland first emerged in Europe as an important political subject. That was overwhelmingly due to our rulers, but Greater Poland played a major part as well, since it was this region that provided support for their activities whose aim was the creation of a state. If later the term *Polonia* denoted both the whole country and the original domain of Mieszko I, it also meant commemorating the area where all had begun – since *it was here that Poland was born*.\n\nThe exhibition invites guests to participate in an archaeological journey into the Middle Ages, to meet the people and events of the period. The guides of that particular trip will be the eyewitnesses – old chroniclers and travellers whose reports illustrate the subject in question on panels placed on the walls of the exhibition rooms. More detailed information can be found on pulled-out boards – there guests will find a description of various aspects of the medieval life, a result of many years of scientific research. Boxes next to the display cases contain additional information and collections of source materials relevant to the topic. In Room II you can make use of numerous multimedia presentations, and at the end of the visit you are invited to try on a replica of a late mediaeval suit of armour and play a game of chess. Each section of the exhibition is accompanied by sound effects: sounds of nature and music from the Middle Ages.','https://goout.net/i/114/1149382-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14746,6),(32388,'Prehistory of Greater Poland','*Prehistory of Greater Poland* is a permanent exhibition illustrating the earliest history of ​our region from the beginning of human settlement until the end of antiquity. A principal – and in the case of the earliest times the only – source of information about the past is the remains of material culture. Due to their one-sidedness, it is impossible to reconstruct fully all the spheres of life of prehistoric societies. However, the abundance of archaeological artefacts discovered in Greater Poland helps researchers describe successive prehistoric ages and reconstruct some aspects of everyday life. Our exhibition is aimed to show the most interesting artefacts and their context reconstructed on the basis of finds and studies. By displaying models of people, animals, homesteads, and graves, we want to bring the visitors closer to the long-forgotten world of our ancestors. The artefacts come from the broadly defined area of Greater Poland and the majority of them are in the Museum’s collection. Some exhibits have been loaned to us by other archaeological institutions.','https://goout.net/i/114/1149339-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14746,6),(32389,'Ikona – Obraz i słowo: Między tym co ulotne a wieczne','The doctrine of the Orthodox Church has its own indivisible and unified image, manifested in religious ritual, its art and symbolism.

Its mood and arrangement, transports the viewer into an unknown, mysterious space, which evokes emotions, penetrating into the deepest spirituality. The extraordinary experience of visiting the museum is heightened by the omnipresent music, a single-voice choral chant for the contemplation of the holy images, in accordance with the words of the Fathers of the Church: \"Let your voice sing and your reason meditate diligently on the world\".','https://goout.net/i/111/1119771-383.jpg','2016-01-01 13:00:00','2038-01-01 01:00:00',14814,5),(32390,'Exhibition of palace interiors of the 18th and 19th centuries','Of the palace\'s original furnishings, only two fireplace panels with the Gryf of the Branicki family and the Ciołek of the Poniatowski family have survived and are displayed in the former Branicki flats, where there are also portraits of the residence\'s owners and people associated with them: kings August III and Stanisław August Poniatowski and General Stanisław Mokronowski.

His international reputation has been consolidated by his significant contributions to the creation of new forms of musical expression. In the early 1990s, Fennesz became involved in Vienna\'s techno scene. Although formally trained in guitar and ethnomusicology, the artist decided to take up composing and developing his own language of sounds in the electronic idiom. By connecting his guitar to a laptop, transforming and processing it, he managed to create a distinctive sound that is hard to mistake for another.\n\nOn his first full-length solo release, *Hotel Para.lel*, he introduced a mix of legal textures and twisted guitar sounds. The album won the Prix Ars Electronica award. His groundbreaking third album *Endless Summer* is today considered one of the most important releases of the 21st century, helping to change the perception of electronic music. On it, he gave great importance to melody, appearing delicately under (or over) the changing soundscape. He has recorded and performed with Ryuichi Sakamoto, David Sylvian, Kev Martin, Keith Rowe, Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse, Mike Patton and many others. Fennesz has also collaborated with Peter Rehberg and Jim O\'Rourke as the improvisational trio Fenn O\'Berg.','https://goout.net/i/124/1249004-383.jpg','2024-04-21 20:00:00','2027-04-21 20:00:00',14600,5),(32395,'Adam French','# British singer-songwriter Adam French will visit Krakow\'s Alchemy.\n\nAdam French is from Congleton, Cheshire East, a small town in northwest England.
